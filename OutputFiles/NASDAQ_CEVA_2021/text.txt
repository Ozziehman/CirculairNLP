The message  
of the Chairman
2021 was a unique year for all of us and the CMA 
CGM Group. 
While the world continues to live at the pace of 
the pandemic, the global economy's strong reco-
very has led to an increase in trade, resulting in 
the growth of our business. Despite the difficult 
circumstances, our employees have shown exem-
plary commitment and I would like to thank them 
for this. 
Throughout the year, we have accelerated our 
CSR strategy:  we have strengthened the three 
pillars on which it is based: acting for planet, 
people and fair trade. And we support the ini-
tiatives and ten principles of the United Nations 
Global Compact. 
To take just a few examples:
– 
We responded to the health crisis. Our prio-
rity, of course, was to protect the health of our 
employees around the world - especially our 
seafarers, for whom vaccination was a major 
challenge. We also mobilised the Group's logis-
tical expertise to continue to deliver medical 
supplies to the parts of the world that were hit 
hardest by the pandemic. 
– 
We have accelerated our energy transition, 
investing heavily to develop our 'e-methane 
ready' fleet powered by liquefied natural gas, 
which will include 44 vessels by 2024. And we 
have signed major partnerships to accelerate 
the development of alternative fuels. To support 
this ambition, we have joined the UN Global 
Compact's "Race to Zero" and are committed to 
achieving net-zero by 2050.
– 
 Our Foundation, which represents the Group's 
spirit of solidarity, has continued its initiatives to 
promote education for everyone. We created 
the social innovation incubator "Le Phare" in 
Marseille. We continued to respond to huma-
nitarian emergencies by providing aid to popu-
lations in distress and pursued our solidarity 
actions, particularly in Lebanon.   
Our CSR policy is at the heart of our strategy. In 
addition to our economic footprint, we now consi-
der our social, societal and environmental foot-
print in every decision we make.
Our objective is clear: to be an exemplary 
stakeholder in global supply chains. With our 
size, our position at the heart of world trade, our 
pioneering and entrepreneurial spirit, we can and 
we want to lead our clients, our partners and our 
entire sector towards a virtuous dynamic.
Aware of our responsibilities and strengthened by
our human and family values, we are more deter-
mined than ever to continue this transformation.

an exemplary player in global 
supply chains. »

In February 2021, CMA CGM 
created a new division dedicated to 
air freight transport. Operated by 
Air Belgium, CMA CGM AIR 
CARGO's main objectives are to 
meet the growing needs of its 
customers, to diversify its offer in a 
context of strong tensions on the 
global supply chains and to 
strengthen its investments to 
accompany the growth of the 
transport market in the coming 
years. These aircraft have the best 
environmental performance in the 
sector.

S TR ATEGY
In 2021, the Group inaugurated a new signature: 
BETTER WAYS. It embodies the ambition of our 
strategy led by Rodolphe Saadé, Chairman and 
CEO of the Group: to build more efficient and res-
ponsible international economic exchanges. This 
new signature is based on the history and core 
values of CMA CGM Group: excellence, boldness, 
exemplarity and imagination.

A SIGNATURE THAT 
EMBODIES OUR STRATEGIC 
AMBITION
-  1 9  -

A reinforced ambition
COP26 and the Glasgow Climate Pact, but also the 
health crisis and the economic difficulties that have 
affected all world markets since 2020 have reinforced a 
global awareness: companies have a major role to play in 
responding to major societal and environmental challenges. 
In this context, CMA CGM wishes to fully contribute to the 
establishment of responsible supply chains, in partnership 
with its clients and suppliers. 
Rodolphe Saadé,  
Chairman and CEO of CMA CGM Group
“CMA CGM Group's 
mission, as a leader 
in transport and 
logistics, is to 
develop fairer and 
more balanced 
economic exchanges 
that respect every 
human being and 
the planet.”

3. Accelerating innovation and digitalisation
4. 
Developing solutions that are more respectful

5. 

day to develop the company. 
The strategy is structured 
around 5 strategic pillars: 
RACE TO ZERO:  
A MORE AMBITIOUS  
CLIMATE STRATEGY
As a major stakeholder in maritime transport and 
logistics, we have long been aware that we have a 
role to play as well as a responsibility to address 
major environmental and climate challenges. The 
conclusions of the sixth IPCC report published 
in August 2021, coupled with the growing num-
ber of warnings and "calls to action" from major 
stakeholders to limit global warming, have further 
strengthened our determination to drastically 
reduce our carbon emissions. 
In 2020, we are committed to achieving carbon 
neutrality by 2050. This year we are going fur-
ther by joining the Race to Zero launched by the 
United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) initiative. 
It is a global campaign that mobilises a coalition 
of "Net Zero Carbon" initiatives. Net-Zero goes 
beyond carbon neutrality by focusing on emission 
reductions rather than offsets. As of 31/12/2021, 
4475 institutions, companies or NGOs are com-
mitted to achieving Net Zero carbon emissions by 
2050. Together, these players cover almost 25% of 
global CO2 emissions and more than 50% of GDP. 
CMA CGM has decided to invest in this "Race to 
Zero" and thus demonstrate its commitment to 
climate protection and biodiversity.

The 12 chapters of the CMA CGM 2021 Non financial performance Report  
are now constituted based on the 12 identified priorities: 
Materiality matrix 
and non-financial risks
In 2021, CMA CGM Group received support to 
strengthen its Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) approach. As a result, 19 issues and 12 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
priorities has been identified. 
The general management and the members of 
the executive committee participated in this 
exercise: they validated and positioned the 
issues according to their importance about the 
Group' activities and locations.  In a participa-
tory approach, hundreds of employees around 
the world were also involved by answering an 
online questionnaire.  
Group CSR issues have been classified into 
three categories:  
– 
key issues for societal engagement, 
– 
key issues for the Group's efficiency  
and societal impact,
– 
strategic issues for sustainable performance. 
The vertical axis of the matrix reveals the impor-
tance of stakeholders' expectations and the hori-
zontal axis ranks the issues according to their 
importance for the economic performance of 
CMA CGM Group. These issues have enabled us 
to identify the Group's ESG priorities, which are 
the basis for our actions.

Methodology
Group Risk Management is responsible for 
structuring, deploying and monitoring the 
risk management framework and supporting 
tools.
The methodology of risk assessment that 
considers net risk (current residual risk) and 
planned residual risk (risk level projected at 
n+12 months) is based on a Group risk eva-
luation matrix structured on two criteria:
– 
Impact severity and,
– Likelihood.
With regards to Corporate Governance, 
all works are regularly reported, on a 
quarterly basis a minima during :
– 
the Operational Risks Committee, 
– 
the RCAI (Risk, Compliance, Audit & 
Inspection) Committee and,
–  
the Audit and Accounting Committee 
(extension of the Board of Directors).
OUR PARTNERSHIP 
APPROACH 
CMA CGM's Sustainable Development strategy is 
based on a collaborative approach. Our goal is to 
follow a common path with all our stakeholders, 
where everyone has a role to play. Our clients 
influence our actions according to their business 
needs and their CSR strategies. Our suppliers 
support us in our efforts towards a more sustai-
nable model which we are developing globally. 
Finally, our investors are encouraging us to imple-
ment a more virtuous business model. 
We have dialogue throughout the year on the 
Group's sustainability issues and ambitions with 
the stakeholders identified below: : 
– Shareholders 
– CMA CGM Group Management
– Staff and staff representatives 
– Clients
– Suppliers
– 
Investors & Financial and non-financial rating 
agencies
– Partners
– Academic world
– NGOs & Associations
PRESENTATION OF CSR RISKS 
In 2021, the CMA CGM Group enhanced its CSR 
risk assessment methodology and constructed a 
more detailed risk mapping with the joint contri-
bution of the CSR team and the Group Risk Mana-
gement department. 
This year, the scope has been extended to cover 
all Group activities and the approach structured 
around the three pillars of People, Planet and Fair 
Trade. The framework also integrates the notion 
of Key Risk Indicators and their associated criti-
cal thresholds for better risk monitoring with the 
identification of a Risk Owner for each risk. 
According to Group methodology, the CSR risk 
mapping is monitored and updated regularly.
As a result, around 20 CSR risks have been iden-
tified and categorised as follows: 
– 
Non-compliance with “ethics and compliance” 
regulations, particularly with regards to 
competition, corruption, economic sanctions 
and personal data protection.
– 
Human rights, health and safety, security and 
working conditions
– 
Climate change, pollution and damage to 
biodiversity
– 
Talent development  
– 
Partnerships with suppliers and subcontractors.
In addition, this risk mapping has highlighted:
– 
the increasing regulatory constraints in all 
regions of the world affecting all aspects of CSR 
(environmental, social and ethical aspects) and,
OUR CSR STRATEGY
THE GREEN TAXONOMY 
The main objective of the European Union's 
"green deal" is to reduce GHG emissions by 55% 
between 1990 and 2030, as a first step, and then 
to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.  In addition 
to many other measures, the taxonomy will enable 
the EU to achieve these objectives by promoting 
sustainable investment. The taxonomy will allow 
the EU to define which activities will be considered 
environmentally sustainable and also to  benchmark 
companies. For CMA CGM Group, the first step 
will be to define which activities are eligible before 
determining their alignment, based on the technical 
criteria published by the European Union. CMA 
CGM Group, a family-owned, unlisted company, will 
have to publish information in 2023, to determine 
the share of economic activities eligible under the 
green taxonomy. Key performance indicators will 
have to be published in 2024. The Group is already 
preparing for these deadlines and has sought 
support from advisors to perform the exercise. 
– 
the major challenge that the massive decarbo-
nisation of transport and logistics will represent 
for CMA CGM Group in the coming years. 
In 2022, amongst the various measures that the 
CMA CGM Group intends putting in place fea-
tures notably,  
– 
the industrialisation of  all CSR reporting, inclu-
ding CO2 customer reports
– 
the reinforcement of the CSR risks monitoring 
through different transversal committees up to 
Executive Committee level.
The CSR risk mapping and the materiality matrix 
were performed in parallel during 2021. A table 
of correspondence between all stakes and risks 
ensures that all of the Group's CSR topics are 
covered.

CSR governance 
CMA CGM Group's CSR Governance is ensured 
jointly by the Group CSR Executive Committee 
and the Group CSR Department, while CSR 
issues are integrated into the strategic thinking 
of the Group Board of Directors. A network of 
local CSR officers and representatives ensures 
optimal deployment of the Group's CSR strategy 
within each entity and develops local initiatives 
throughout the world.
The Group CSR Executive Committee chaired 
by Rodolphe Saadé and led by the Group CSR 
Department was created in 2021. This committee 
meets once a month. It brings together the 
members of the Executive Committee who are 
most concerned with CSR issues. A representa-
tive of an external stakeholder takes part as well 
as representatives of the younger generation. 
This is the main forum for defining the Group's 
strategy and key CSR performance indicators to 
ensure the Group’s achievements. 
The Group CSR Department ensures that the 
entities implement the strategy and action plans 
at the Group level. It guides and advises manage-
ment and operational staff in the implementation 
of roadmaps by business line and by country or 
region. It monitors and measures progress on the 
12 priorities. It reports on the Group's CSR perfor-
mance to the Executive Committee and ensures 
compliance with regulatory requirements and 
developments.
The Group CSR Department relies on a network 
of regional CSR officers who drive and implement 
the Group's CSR strategy at a local level.  Together 
they form a global team of CSR professionals from 
diverse cultures.
TANYA SAADÉ ZEENNY,  
Executive Vice President

CSR regional referent are responsible for deploy-
ment of  CSR policies into local action plan adap-
ted to the context of each agency, operationali-
sing CSR within the Group's culture, working with 
stakeholders and identifying key local opportuni-

Short-term action plan 
of the CSR strategy 
2022 - 2025
CMA CGM's commitment has led to the setting 
of demanding targets. Furthermore, ESG regu-
lations are becoming increasingly important and 
have an impact on our activities. For this reason, 
the Group is acquiring the means and resources to 
ensure consistency between our voluntary com-
mitments, regulatory constraints and the day-to-
day management of our activities. As a result, we 
have noticed a growing integration of CSR issues 
within the various departments and operational 
functions so that CSR can be integrated as closely 
as possible into our core business.
As part of an approach to structuring actions, the 
CSR teams are being strengthened to ensure the 
definition of trajectories, priorities, quantified 
objectives and action plans, as well as the coordi-
nation and support of projects. 
CSR projects are monitored using performance 
and impact indicators that reflect ambitious 
objectives in line with the Group's 12 priorities. 
Among these indicators, around twenty are 
objectified and monitored every quarter to be 
presented to the CSR Executive Committee. 
The members of the CSR Executive Committee 
are responsible, together with their teams, for 
achieving the CSR performance targets.
All of this is regularly reported to the Board of 
Directors.

(SDGs)
CMA CGM Group's Sustainable Development approach is 
based on three pillars: Acting for people, Acting for planet, 
Acting for fair trade. These pillars cover the Group's 12 
sustainable development priorities (see materiality matrix 
page 21).
By making progress in these areas, CMA CGM Group 
intends to respond to the global challenges set out in the 
17 United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) adopted in 2015.
The SDGs have been segmented into two categories: 
­
– 
Direct contribution: Impact of the Group on the SDG through its transport and logistics activities, 
policies and strategic choices.

– 
Indirect contribution: The Group's impact on the SDGs through its exchanges with stakeholders 
throughout the value chain and through its participation in collective initiatives.

ENSURING THE PROTECTION 
OF EMPLOYEES 
CMA CGM Group is committed to a global 
approach that aims to strengthen the health 
and safety of its employees on land and at sea. 
In 2021, despite the ongoing complex health 
situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the 
Group has increased its commitment to protec-
ting and listening to its employees. 
The Group has been proactive in providing the 
best possible working conditions for everyone, 
whether at sea, in offices, terminals, warehouses 
and storage or at home.
There are specific risks associated with certain 
activities and jobs on vessels, terminals and 
warehouses and depots. We are therefore com-
mitted to ensuring the safety of our staff in all our 
activities, as well as our facilities and the goods 
transported.
Several targeted initiatives on this subject have 
also made it possible to further raise the awar-
eness of our employees, always in line with a 
safety culture that is strongly anchored within 
CMA CGM Group.
PROMOTING  
EDUCATION  
AND TRAINING
CMA CGM Group, with its international dimension 
and the diversity of its activities and businesses, is 
committed to the development of its employees. 
To further develop key skills and expertise related 
to the evolution of our business, we are harmo-
nising our processes and tools at a global level, 
offering mobility opportunities and job bridges 
 
to enable everyone to grow and develop within 
the Group.
Thanks to CMA CGM Academy, our training offer 
evolves to offer innovative, more diversified, 
more digitalized solutions on the Group's global 
scale-up.
SUPPORTING  
DIVERSITY  
AND INCLUSION
The diversity of our employees is what makes 
CMA CGM Group so rich. 
In 2021 and in 2022 the Group has particularly 
focused on: gender equality, intergenerational 
diversity and cultural diversity. The Group is com-
mitted to providing equal opportunities for suc-
cess to all and to fostering a fair and inclusive wor-
king environment.
SUPPORTING LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES
We encourage our employees all over the world 
to get involved in voluntary initiatives for the 
benefit of those in need because we believe 
that it is necessary to commit ourselves to a res-
ponsible and supportive society today more 
 
than ever. 
Thanks to our network of CSR network, these ini-
tiatives are multiplying and the involvement of our 
employees continues to grow. Our goal for 2022 is 
to have at least one local initiative in every country 
where we operate. 
Solidarity is also at the heart of the CMA CGM 
Foundation, chaired by Tanya Saadé Zeenny. The 
Foundation works as close to the field as possible 
to help children and young people find their place 
through education, the key to human develop-
ment. In addition, with its social incubator, the 
CMA CGM Foundation is directly involved in the 
creation of innovative and social enterprises for 
the benefit of the Marseille area. 
ACTING FOR PEOPLE
ENSURING RESPECT  
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS  
IN THE VALUE CHAIN
Since 2018, every year, CMA CGM Group publi-
shes its vigilance plan, reporting on the changes 
implemented concerning fundamental freedoms, 
human rights, health and safety, and environmental 
risks related to the Group's activities and those of its 
subcontractors and suppliers. In 2021, we continued 
to expand and strengthen the integration of this Act 
in all the Group's activities at the headquarters and 
operational levels by following the 5 measures: risk 
mapping, monitoring of measures, evaluation proce-
dures, appropriate actions and alert mechanism.
OUR CSR STRATEGY

FIGHTING AGAINST  
CLIMATE CHANGE
The maritime sector has already begun its energy 
transition under the guidance of the regulatory 
framework established by the International Mari-
time Organisation and the European Union. As 
part of a voluntary approach, CMA CGM Group 
has set objectives that go beyond the regula-
tions and is voluntarily committed to becoming 
Net-Zero by 2050 and to integrating 10% of alter-
native fuels in its energy mix by 2023. To achieve 
these objectives, the Group has chosen to use 
LNG propulsion and is actively working on opti-
mising the performance of its vessels, developing 
low-carbon fuels and improving the efficiency of 
its operations. The terminals and CEVA Logis-
tics activities are now included in the Group's 
decarbonisation plan: the Group has set targets 
for reducing energy consumption and using 
renewable energies in these activities. CEVA 
Logistics supports the development of alter-
native energies, such as biofuels, and relies on 
modal shift by offering river or rail alternatives to 
road transport.
IMPROVING  
AIR QUALITY
CMA CGM Group also deploys solutions to reduce 
emissions of atmospheric pollutants. In particu-
lar, the Group is developing its fleet of LNG ships 
to avoid almost all emissions of sulphur oxides, 
nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. The Group 
also equips its ships with shore power. We are also 
working to limit emissions of pollutants on shore: 
CEVA Logistics has deployed several electric truck 
pilots in its fleet and is working on the development 
of new solutions.
PROTECTING MARINE AND 
INLAND BIODIVERSITY
The Group is involved in several actions to preserve 
biodiversity on a global scale. These actions aim 
to reduce our impact on biodiversity on the one 
hand and to restore it on the other. The Group's 
vessels are operated in such a way as to minimise 
their impact on marine life by adapting their speed 
to local conditions, for example. The Group is also 
involved in the restoration of fragile ecosystems such 
as those affected by the 2021 fires, particularly in the 
south of France, through reforestation projects.
PROMOTING A CIRCULAR 
ECONOMY
CMA CGM is committed to developing a circular 
economy about its global activities. First of all, this 
ACTING FOR PLANET
means reducing waste from maritime and logistics 
activities. This desire is also reflected in various 
initiatives that work to limit the amount of plas-
tic discharged into the natural environment. The 
Group also seeks to make better use of its waste 
by recycling its damaged containers and dismant-
ling its end-of-life vessels.

BE EXEMPLARY  
IN OUR BUSINESS 
CMA CGM Group is committed to setting the 
standards in ethics and compliance. We are com-
mitted to promoting responsible international 
trade through strict compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations We encourage and support 
our suppliers and customers to adopt best prac-
tices with us.
Ethics Hotline, our secure whistleblowing facility, 
is available 24/7.
PROVIDING INNOVATIVE 
AND SUSTAINABLE SERVICES 
TO OUR CLIENTS
We continue to innovate for the benefit of our cus-
tomers and the planet. Throughout the difficult 
Covid-19 pandemic, CMA CGM Group has demons-
trated its ability to be at the forefront of cargo trans-
portation and delivery operations worldwide.
We continued to develop an innovative service offer 
Act with CMA CGM+. It includes 45 value-added 
products, ranging from guarantee and protection 
of goods to claims management, environmental 
services and a "Business Support" which supports 
clients in their activity growth. In terms of environ-
mental protection, we have put in place a range of 
solutions, including digital ones, to help our cus-
tomers reduce their transportation carbon footprint 
and offset their emissions.
We are also putting in place alternative multimodal 
transport solutions, particularly rail and barge, which 
emit less greenhouse gas, and which will represent 
75% of our inland transport by 2025.
CONTRIBUTING TO A 
RESPONSIBLE VALUE CHAIN
Our commitments can only be sustainable if we 
involve all our stakeholders, starting with our 
suppliers and partners, whom we want to see 
ACTING FOR FAIR TRADE
progress towards the highest standards of sus-
tainability. We have therefore implemented a 
global assessment program for suppliers and 
subcontractors.

Ensuring the protection  
of employees 
We aim to ensure their safety, health and their well-being at 
work. In 2021, the Group has implemented a global safety policy 
(Safety First). The challenge is to minimise the risk exposure of our 
employees - both onshore and offshore - to our commercial and 
operational activities. This applies to health, the environment and 
technological risks relating to our facilities and all the modes of 
transport we operate - vessels, trains, barges, trucks, aircraft, ports 
and terminals. During this second year of the global pandemic, 
even greater attention was paid to ensuring that every employee 
received the best possible attention, prevention and protection.
Today, the Group has 5 main categories with varied, complementary 
activities and jobs:
By December 31 2021, the num-
ber of employees in the Group will 
reach 82 
582*: 77 
238 employees, 
5 
344 international seafarers. 
In 2020 the number of new hires was 
19 625 and the number of depar-
tures was 18 691. In 2021, we hired 
26 837 people and recorded 23 712 
departures.

GROUP SAFETY & 
SECURITY POLICY
In 2021, risk mapping has evolved into 
5 similar levels of severity in all Group 
departments. 
A Quality Safety Security Environment 
(QSSE) policy has been defined imple-
menting common principles in all ter-
minals, warehouses and depots based 
on 10 critical risks. Sites must ensure 
compliance with the requirements of 
this policy. 
QSSE, CMA SHIPS or external audits 
have been standardised with a list of 
checkpoints by major ship functions. 
Based on this, an assessment of the ves-
sel's condition (low, normal, medium, 
high) is carried out weekly in collabo-
ration with the fleet department and 
reported to the management.
Modern technological tools are regu-
larly developed in-house with new 
functionalities by the captains of the 
fleet management centres to mitigate 
navigational risks (weather, etc.). They 
are then made available to the captains 
and officers on board the Group's ships. 
These include navigation aids or deci-
sion support systems for navigating in 
bad weather, crossing piracy zones and 
arriving in congested ports.
For the Group's business travellers 
there is a platform called SSF LOCATOR 
which has been extended to CMA CGM 
and CEVA Logistics employees. This 
platform has been designed to help 
business travellers prepare for their 
trips and to enable the Group's Security 
Department to intervene rapidly in the 
event of an emergency (natural disaster, 
security incident, etc.).
OUR AMBITIONS AND GOALS 
• 
Prevent any accident that could result in injury or loss of life to any of our personnel, as well as any 
significant damage to our facilities, goods or the environment.
• No fatalities 
• 
-40% of accidents at sea and in terminals resulting in more than one day's absence from work in 2025 
compared to 2019
• Ensuring that 100% of employees have an access to health coverage by 2022
ACTING FOR PEOPLE
"The promotion of a safety culture remains a major 
objective for the Group. Raising employee awareness 
means being able to understand the environment 
and act in an industrial setting, to understand the 
risks, and to make the right decisions in time to avoid 
compromising and deliver the quality of service 
expected by our clients.

PROMOTING 
SAFETY CULTURE IN 
EVERYDAY LIFE
Maritime safety culture  
The maritime and inland safety culture 
is part of CMA CGM Group's commit-
ment to go further through targeted 
initiatives. As human error is the major 
causal factor, a Safety Improvement 
Plan has been deployed in 6 points:
1 -	
Assessment of the level of safety 
awareness at work through an indivi-
dual assessment by the Marine Supe-
rintendents (MSI). 
2 -	
Training and awareness-raising of 
shore teams in the safety culture nee-
ded to achieve sustainable changes in 
the company's safety level by relying on 
recognised stakeholders in industrial 
safety.
3 -	Launch of onboard training with the 
deployment of digital tools (XLABS and 
TEAM S& WE2D) and support for sea-
The Fleet Navigation Center 
(operational nerve centre), 
which allows real-time 
monitoring of all the world 
fleet vessel movements 
operated by the Group, has 
undergone an innovation: the 
installation of a panoramic 
full-LED bay that can display 
up to twenty screens, with 
new functionalities, such as 
live monitoring of the vessel 
manoeuvres equipped with 
the "Bird Eye View" camera 
system.
A crisis cell now adjoins the 
control room, equipped 
with a specific screen and 
the possibility of interacting 
directly with the vessel 
commanders by video 
conference for faster and 
more effective decision-
making. 
farers through seminars and a digital 
application (SAFYR).
4 -	Onboard management training in 
team management with Bridge Resource 
Management (BRM) training. The aim of 
this programme is simple: reduce the 
risk of accidents by helping the crew to 
anticipate and react appropriately to the 
various events that occur on board the 
ships. . 
5 -	Strengthening the fire-fighting skills 
of maritime personnel through on 
board training. 
6 -	Strengthening safety knowledge by 
sharing real cases every week through 
the "Weekly SSE Focus" tool based on 
the analysis of safety barriers.
TOUCH is the management tool for 
owned fleet. It is used for crewing 
management, certifications, supply, 
documents management, resting 
hours, payroll and maritime security. 
Those different modules facilitate daily 
operations on board and assure data 
security. 
Furthermore, weekly feedback is pro-
vided on accidents that have occur-
red on board ships to inform and raise 
awareness of the best practices to be 
implemented.  
Safety culture for inland, 
logistics and terminal 
activities
Based on feedback, safety events were 
grouped under 10 Critical Risk Stan-
dards (CRS): natural disasters, fire and 
explosion, collision, cargo handling, fall 
from height, environment, ships, main-
tenance/energy, security, occupational 
health and safety.
The methodology for dealing with these 
risks, the requirements and qualifica-
tions needed, and the tools that enable 
every site to prepare their action plan by 
adapting it to local, regulatory, environ-
mental and operational specificities are 
associated with each of these risks.
Tin@ application for reporting and ana-
lysing incidents has been deployed in 
the Terminals and land-based activities 
area and is intended to be deployed in 
all directorates to provide the trans-
parency and responsiveness required 
when a risk occurs.
Lastly, the sites promote a safety culture 
and raise awareness among their 
employees with a dedicated safety 
exchange tool, the Toolbox Meeting. 
The Weekly Safety Feedback issued by 
the head office shares good practices 
with an analysis of significant events to 
improve the safety culture.
The Monthly Report brings together 
initiatives, performance news, acciden-
tally and thus gives an overview of the 
Terminal and land site achievements in 
a continuous improvement process.
In 2021, CEVA Logistics also continued 
to develop its "safety behaviour pro-
gram” in several countries. 
The CEVA Logistics HSE (Health Safety 
Environment) Council, consisting of 
leaders from all regions, is responsible 
for facilitating and delivering HSE per-
formance. In 2021, particular emphasis 
was placed on the safety of new sites 
and subcontractors.
ADOPT 
INTERNATIONAL 
CERTIFICATIONS
Adopting international standards 
helps the Group to operate more 
efficiently, make its processes more 
reliable and deliver a high quality of 
service. 
In the Logistics sector, in addition to 
the above certifications, additional 
sector-specific standards can be set 
up. These include ISO 27001 (infor-
mation security), EN 9100 (for aero-
nautics), GXP Pharma, ISO 13485 (for 
medical devices), IATF/TS 16949 (for 
the automotive industry), ISO 50001 
(energy management), and most 
recently, IATA certification for the air 
transport of lithium batteries. This 
modular management allows CEVA 
Logistics to respond on a case-by-
case basis to its client’s specific 
needs and propose the highest 
industry standards.

MAIN ACCIDENTS 
INVOLVING THE 
GROUP'S ASSETS 
The severity of events is classified on a 
scale-up from A to D (D being the most 
severe event), which includes four main 
categories of fallout: 
–	 
Impact on health and safety of 
equipment and people 
–	 
Environmental impact
–	 
Financial impact 
In 2021, four major maritime incidents 
and three major terminal incidents were 
recorded. 4 major maritime incidents:
–	 
APL GWANGYANG: Collision of the 
vessel with a shoal leading to floo-
ding of the bow thruster room due 
to water ingress
–	 
APL LE HAVRE: Collision with a 
fishing vessel off the west coast of 
India
–	 
APL VANCOUVER: Structural 
damage due to cracking of the hull 
at the weld joints
–	 
PRESIDENT EISENHOWER: machine

In 2021, three major incidents in the 
terminals:
–	 
A major fire that broke out acciden-
tally during operations on the yard, 
resulting in the loss of a gantry crane 
and the loss of 4 containers 
–	 
An aerial bombardment that hit 77 
containers but fortunately did not 
cause any injuries to people on site
–	 
A fatal accident involving a 
subcontractor hit by a truck 
manoeuvring in a car park
RESCUE  
OPERATIONS  
The entire maritime sector works 
together to save lives. At any given 
time, it may be necessary to divert ves-
sels in order to assist a vessel in distress. 
Search and rescue (SAR) is the search 
for and provision of assistance to per-
sons in distress or imminent danger. 
Shipping companies are regularly 
asked by the Maritime Rescue Centre 
(MRC) to participate in the rescue of 
people at sea. In addition, CMA CGM 
Group is a member of AMVER (Auto-
mated Mutual Assistance Vessel Res-
cue), a worldwide voluntary reporting 
system sponsored by the USCG (United 
States Coast Guard).
In 2021, CMA CGM vessels carried out 
7 operations at sea worldwide.

 OBJECTIVES
CONTROL AND 
MANAGEMENT 
OF HAZARDOUS 
MATERIALS 
CMA CGM Group transports a wide 
variety of cargoes, ranging from general 
cargo to dangerous goods, manufac-
tured goods and consumer products. 
Some of them may present a risk during 
transport. For this reason, the Group 
has set up a specialised team to inspect, 
analyse and prevent risks related to the 
transport of goods. In addition, through 
a specialised software application linked 
to the global reservation system, the 
Group can manage hazardous items. This 
application integrates the international 
regulations, which allows to control the 
way dangerous goods are declared, then 
packed and stored in the container.
CMA CGM Group makes every effort to 
prevent the illegal transport of goods, in 
accordance with regulations and its code 
of ethics. In 2021, the Group acquired 
a Safety Cargo Control (SCC) device 
capable of detecting dangerous goods 
that have not been declared as such. The 
aim is to stop non-compliant shipments 
in terms of dangerous goods declara-
tions. In addition, this computer software 
tool, developed in-house and containing 
the majority of international rules and 
restrictions, enables us to respond more 
quickly to our clients' requests regarding 
the feasibility of a booking.  
CEVA Logistics also strictly follows the 
guidelines for the acceptance, hand-
ling, storage and transport of hazardous 
materials. These guidelines are summa-
rised in our hazardous materials policy in 
full compliance with local and internatio-
nal laws and regulations.
Training is a key element of CEVA Logis-
tics' hazardous materials policy. All 
sites managing dangerous cargo must 
have at least two IATA (International 
Air Transport Association) certificates 
and two employees must be trained in 
IMDG (International Code for the Mari-
time transport of Dangerous Goods). 
Employees dealing with dangerous 
goods must also undergo specific trai-
ning on the risks associated with these 
goods, including a set of methods and 
actions to improve their safety and avoid 
injury. CEVA Logistics QHSE Department 
ensures the organisation of this system. 
CEVA Logistics has also developed a 
specific offer for the management (trans-
port and storage) of lithium batteries for 
its customers. This expertise has been 
recognised by IATA (International Air 
Transport Association) through the “CEIV 
(Center of Excellence for Independent 
Validators) LiBA " certification issued in 
October 2021 in Dublin.

SUPPORTING 
OUR EMPLOYEES 
IN TIMES OF 
TRANSFORMATION
In 2021, given the still complex 
health situation, the main focus has 
been on preserving the health and 
safety of our employees.
In France, as well as internationally, a 
2-day worldwide teleworking agree-
ment has been put in place. The re-
turn of staff to the office was gradual 
and based on the recommendations 
of the local government authorities. 
Our priority is to maintain contact with 
employees, develop their comfort le-
vel with digital tools and train them in 
the hybrid work mode. The Group also 
took care to support managers in the 
management of their remote teams.
During this health crisis, the Group 
has put in place several actions to 
remain attentive and maintain the 
relationship with its employees.
A Covid-19 survey was conducted in 
France and abroad. In France, there 
were 2,700 respondents to the ques-
tion "How are you coping with this 
new confinement?" Abroad 1,471 
people responded to the question-
naire distributed in 4 countries (Spain, 
Germany, Malaysia, Singapore). A sur-
vey on the preventive measures taken 
by CEVA Logistics against COVID-19 
was also deployed at the end of 2020: 
it showed the strong support of the 
employees for these measures. As a 
result, the measures continued and 
were extended in 2021.
We communicated on a regular basis 
with employees via HR newsletters, 
informing them of the implementa-
tion of health measures. Similarly, to 
support their return to the office in the 
best possible conditions, communica-
tion campaigns have been initiated, in 
particular the "Return" campaign at 
CMA CGM headquarters in Marseille.
In line with this approach and response 
to the isolation caused by the various 
confinements, 
virtual 
workshops 
called "Keep in Touch" were orga-
nised for employees at CEVA Logis-
tics headquarters in Marseille, volun-
tarily. Several topics were addressed, 
including the management of remote 
work, work-life balance, etc. Several 
speakers were also invited to these 
workshops, which were attended by 
one-third of the headquarters staff.  
To support distance work and the 
gradual return, educational tools 
have also been made available to 
our employees:
CMA CGM Academy has offered trai-
ning in the form of short instructional 
videos: (" how to effectively work from 
a distance ", "how to improve interper-
sonal relations” etc…)
In 2021, the new C-Box "Welcome 
back" was launched to support the 
collaborators returning to the offices. 
C-Box is a set of tools that allows teams 
to solve a specific problem. Thus, any 
employee can organise a workshop 
independently. The purpose is to es-
tablish, at the level of every team, an 
organisation, rituals, and communica-
tion that allow the best of both worlds 
to be brought together, between re-
mote work and face-to-face work. 
In line with the measures initiated at 
the Group level, in 2021 CEVA Lo-
gistics continued in 2021 to deploy a 
global plan to combat the pandemic 
and ensure business continuity, with a 
prevention plan and toolkits that can 
be adapted to all local conditions.
Numerous measures have been coor-
dinated at regional, national and lo-
cal levels: sanitary protection at all 
CEVA Logistics sites, adjusted work 
programmes, temperature tests and 
regular disinfection of the premises. 
They were essential in limiting cases 
of contamination when remote work 
was not possible.  
MAINTAINING THE 
HEALTH AND WELL-
BEING OF OUR 
EMPLOYEES 
The health of our employees continues 
to be a priority for the Group. Rodolphe 
Saadé, Chairman and CEO of CMA 
CGM Group, has spoken to employees 
on several occasions to reassure them 
in this tense international context.
In accordance with the 2021 objec-
tives, 100% of the Group's employees 
will have an access to health coverage 
by the beginning of 2022. In addition, 
all employees are covered by a death 
benefit through local insurance or the 
Group provident fund. 
To provide additional support to its 
employees in case of major difficulties, 
We Care Fund was initiated in 2021 by 
Rodolphe Saadé and will be deployed 
in 2022. 
The health crisis required specific mea-
sures for seagoing personnel. In July 
2021, a vaccination campaign in Mar-
seille for crews calling at the French 
port of Fos-sur-Mer and Marseille was 
organised. More than 6 700 of the 9 000 
seafarers are now vaccinated at the end 
of this year.

 OBJECTIVES
FOR A BETTER 
QUALITY OF LIFE AT 
WORK
The Group is committed to conti-
nuously improving the quality of life at 
work for its employees, whether they 
are at sea or on land. 
2021 was characterised by the res-
tructuring and consolidation of an 
ambitious action plan to improve the 
quality of life at work for our seagoing 
personnel in different areas:
–	 
Performance indicators (reinforce-
ment of performance indicators on 
quality of life at work via an indivi-
dual social barometer carried out 
periodically)
–	 
Physical activity (standardisation of 
sports equipment on board ships)
–	 
Sleep (improved quality of bed-
ding)
–	 
Food (standardisation and quality 
improvement of kitchen equip-
ment)
–	 
Fitting out (programme for the fit-
ting out of spaces: smoking rooms, 
collective sports area, weight room, 
an extension of the premises allo-
cated to the storage of fresh pro-
duce)
–	 
Connectivity (improved quality and 
on-board internet access)
–	 
Support (hotline for psychological 
assistance for seafarers)
To improve the working conditions 
of our inland and terminal logistics 
teams, we disseminate best practices 
regarding screen work and provide 
rest areas. 
CEVA Logistics employees can bene-
fit from various measures for risk pre-
vention in general. In line with CMA 
CGM's guidelines, CEVA Logistics 
employees are covered by life and 
pension insurances,  which has been 
set up in their home entity. A life and 
pension insurance is a contract that 
allows the subscriber to protect him-
self or his family against the financial 
consequences of a health problem 
following, for example, an accident or 
illness.

FOR A BETTER WORK-
LIFE BALANCE
Our aim is to promote a balance 
between private and professional life 
and the well-being at work of our em-
ployees. In 2021, the Group announced 
the implementation of teleworking ar-
rangements for employees worldwide 
and therefore offers the possibility for 
all countries to implement this remote 
working organisation depending on 
the nature of their activities. 
For CMA CGM France and CEVA Lo-
gistics head office employees based 
in Marseille, a teleworking charter has 
been signed so that they can benefit 
from 2 days of remote working per 
week. A teleworking guide has also 
been made available as well as a de-
dicated training course to support em-
ployees and managers with the help of 
the CMA CGM Academy. 
A disconnection charter was also 
signed in October 2021 to enable a 
better work-life balance and the right 
to disconnect for employees at CEVA 
Logistics' headquarters in Marseille.
CMA CGM's HR School Relations team 
runs a community dedicated to the 
150 interns and work-study students to 
overcome the isolation of students by 
proposing numerous joint activities. 
CMA CGM Netherlands offers its 
teams daily 30-minute team walks 
with competitions via an application 
(developed by the Dutch Brain Foun-
dation). Awareness and prevention 
programmes for managers have also 
been set up to better report, prevent 
and reintegrate the long-term sick by 
the occupational health agency. 
CMA CGM Estonia has implemented 
the MIND Project which aims to pro-
mote, educate and support the phy-
sical and psychological well-being of 
employees. This is an animated pod-
cast covering the topics of health and 
safety at work to increase employee 
awareness.
In 2021, the "Best Innovation" award 
in the "Asia Best Workplace" catego-
ry was presented to CMA CGM China 
by AIA, a leading Asian life insurance 
company, in partnership with the 
School of Public Health of the Univer-
sity of Beijing and HRoot, a Chinese 
media specialising in HR. This award 
recognises the Group's good prac-
tices in China regarding well-being at 
work with work/life balance and medi-
cal coverage for employees.
Finally, the Group plans to launch a 
Group Commitment survey in 2022 
to listen to its employees and mea-
sure the social climate and the level 
of commitment of each team in all of 
our divisions.

Promoting education  
and training
2021 marks an important step in the Group's evolution with the 
establishment of Group Human Resources Department that will 
support a global strategy and create international and cross-
functional opportunities for our employees. The development of 
our leaders and the fulfillment of all our employees is at the heart 
of our concerns. 
HARMONISE AND 
CONSOLIDATE OUR 
PROCESSES AND 
PROGRAMMES AT 
THE GROUP LEVEL
In 2021, CMA CGM Group provided 
787 988 hours of training. The aim of 2 
days training per employee per year for 
2021 has been achieved for CMA CGM, 
with 2.66 days. Within the CMA CGM 
Group, the average number of training 
days per employee is 1.55. To support 
the transformation and performance 
of all the Group's divisions, we have 
developed a library of 56 core compe-
tencies, a Group people review, a cross

This library provides every employee 
with a transparent understanding of 
the skills to be developed in order to 
progress within the Group. We are 
also integrating the Core Competency 
Framework into all our development 
tools and programs to assess and deve-
lop employees in this sense.  
2021 also marked the launch of a global 
evaluation process of the entire Groups' 
workforce (CMA CGM and CEVA Logis-
tics) with a view to succession planning. 
The group is going through a major transformation and is 
meeting a great success thanks to each one of our people 
either in shipping, logistic or airfreight divisions.
In order to ensure that each one of our employees will 
continue to uniquely contribute to our performance and 
growth, we’ve developed a library of 56 key competencies 
as the foundation for a fair, transparent, objective and 
effective Group HR strategy.
Ensuring that key talents and experts alike are identified 
and promoted across the world and cross divisions, 
independently of their gender, age or nationality is key to 
our success and in line with our values.
Mobility and cross fertilization as well as our performance 
and innovation culture are also key drivers to ensure that 
we do have The right people at the right place and at the 
right time to enable the Business strategy and goals.

This process identifies talent, provides 
development goals, access to trai-

lity opportunities. More than 6,300 
employees were assessed up to level 
N-4. 
The global and harmonised Group 
process will be consolidated and the 
evaluation of employees will continue 
in 2022.
We have strengthened our Leadership 
offering with the introduction of new 
programmes for first, middle and senior 
managers, with development starting 
in 2021.
A pilot of one of our leadership pro-
gramme has been launched in the Asia 
Pacific, entitled Excellerate, targeting 
successors to General Managers/
Heads of Department, aimed at deve-
loping leadership skills and networking 
within the network of agencies in the 
region. 
The GM School's second class consists 
of 20 participants from 20 different 
countries. The training aims to support 
General Managers (25% women and 
60% international profiles) in deve-
loping their skills and careers within 
the Group. It is based on three main 
modules: leadership, business and 
development. A CSR course has been 
integrated into the 2021 programme 
to raise awareness of our sustainabi-
lity issues among General Managers, 
and the programme will include future 
General Managers in the 2022 sessions 
to prepare them for a smooth transition 
to their new positions.
In 2021, a Mentoring programme for 
our managers was also launched. A six-
month pilot was set up with the crea-
tion of 59 pairs within CEVA Logistics to 
develop high potential employees. Our 
objective is to launch this programme 
in 2022 for the entire Group. 
In 2022, we want to develop and launch 
an Expert channel to identify, within our 
internal network, experts who will be 
offered a suitable development path, 
enhancing their know-how within the 
Group.
The coaching offer for high potentials, 
managers and top managers within the 
Group was rolled out globally in 2021, 
after a pilot phase at the Group's head-
quarters.

become active players in their careers 
through conferences, business forums, tes-
timonials and HR workshops. The organisa-
tion of this event will continue in 2022 and 
will be extended to the logistics professions 
by including CEVA Logistics.
INVESTING IN YOUNG 
TALENT
Every year, we recruit more than 50% 
of our trainees and apprentices in the 
final year of their studies. At CMA CGM, 
we consider our youngest recruits as a 
real talent source and an investment for 
the future.
In France, the TAMM (Air and Mari-
time Freight Transport) continued its 
momentum. This course, integrated 
into the CMA CGM Academy's Appren-
tice Training Centre (CFA), is designed 
for young Master 2 graduates wishing 
to develop their expertise in the field 
of transport and logistics.
In September 2021, the training of the 
first-class of 16 apprentices was com-
pleted and the training of the second 
class of 23 apprentices began (i.e. +30% 
of recruits). The course lasts one year 
and is a work-study programme within 
the Group. It leads to the RNCP title of 
Air or Sea Freight Transport Organiser, 
as well as a certificate from the CMA 
CGM Academy for the maritime trans-
port sector. 75% of the first-class gra-
duates were recruited within the Group.
Training for trainees' tutors and alter-
nates has been set up with CMA CGM 
Academy. It helps to better prepare 
them for their supervisory and training 
role.
The Graduate Programme SKY has 
been launched by CEVA Logistics in 
new Asia-Pacific countries. The pro-
gramme has also seen improvements 
in other regions, notably in Eastern 
Europe.
The Trade Associates programme was 
launched by CMA CGM Asia Pacific. 
It aims to attract and train young gra-
duates for junior sales roles in the regio-
nal offices. 
The VIE programme (International Work 
Volunteering) enables young graduates 
to carry out a professional mission for 
24 months within our international 
structures. This allows them to develop 
their business expertise, acquire new 
skills while discovering another country 
and other cultures through our network 
of agencies around the world. In 2021, 
CMA CGM and CEVA Logistics welco-
med a total of 50 young people on VIE 
contracts.
For the 7th consecutive year, CMA 
CGM Group has been awarded the 
Happy Index®Trainees label for the 
quality of its internships and work-study 
contracts. 93% of respondents recom-
mend the Group for an internship or 
work experience placement.
The SHL tool for individual assessment of 
competencies and motivation: deployed 
throughout the Group in 2021, helps our 
leaders to identify their strengths and 
become aware of their areas for impro-
vement in order to build a more effective 
personal development plan.

A RICH AND 
INNOVATIVE 
TRAINING OFFER 
In 2021, CMA CGM Academy received 
the U-Spring award, with a special men-
tion in the "strategic transformation" 
category. The award recognised the 
Group's initiatives during the COVID-
19 health crisis, including the massive 
roll-out of remote training, the esta-
blishment of a RapidMOOC studio, 
the development of virtual classrooms 
and the use of the cloud for mandatory 
training for both maritime and ground 
staff.
A corpus of 537 virtual classroom 
courses is currently available. These 
include "Assertiveness & Communica-
tion"; "Change for Managers"; "Intro-
duction to Supply Chain Activities", 
"Corporate Values" and "Customer 
Experience" (for salespeople).
The C-Box concept is a set of play-
oriented tools to facilitate reflection. It 
has been developed for our collabora-
tors in order to inform and raise awar-
eness by solving a specific problem. 
Thanks to this tool, a 3-hour workshop 
can be organised by any employee in 
a completely autonomous way. 3 new 
C-Boxes have been launched in 2021: 
"Sustainability", "Welcome back" and 
"Better Ways". The Sustainability C-Box 
consists of a complete kit to make 
employees aware of environmental 
issues and sustainable development. 
The 7 existing C-Boxes have also been 
digitized.
The skill development of our seagoing 
personnel requires specific and adap-
ted training: 
SAYFR, a digital behaviour-based 
safety simulation solution, has been 
implemented. It’s aim is to increase the 
safety culture of seafarers by sharing 
good practices and to ensure that every 
incident is the starting point for strate-
gic thinking. This project is divided into 
two phases: seminars and coaching ses-
sions for the seafarers. This application 
allows real-life situations to be shared 
and encourages playful exchanges 
around challenges and scoring systems.
The Leadership in Safety training 
course, to be introduced in 2021, aims 
to involve managers and their teams in 
a safer environmental process and to 
provide them with the necessary rea-
ding grids and action levers. These les-
sons will be progressively deployed to 
all CMA SHIPS' maritime and sedentary 
teams.  In addition, firefighting training 
has been provided on board of each 
ship since September 2021 and will 
continue in 2022.
LNG training has been deployed for 
seafarers to train them in how to ope-
rate aboard of ships powered by Lique-
fied Natural Gas (LNG), which requires 
new expertise. 
02 - Promouvoir l'éducation et la formation
The Group offers a wide range of quality 
training courses thanks to CMA CGM 
Academy. In 2021, the digitalisation and 
internationalisation of the offer continued. 
It will continue to be enriched according to 
the Group's employees' training needs.

Committing to diversity 
and inclusion
The diversity of our employees is what makes CMA CGM Group 
so rich.  We believe that diversity and inclusion are key to building 
innovative and successful teams. 
Our goal is to promote diversity and inclusion within the Group by 
acting on 3 main axes: 
- Gender parity, to give women the place and the strategic role 
they deserve in our sectors of activity.
- Intergenerational diversity, which we encourage by setting up 
complementary teams.
- Cultural diversity and the internationalisation of teams, which 
we continue to promote and which represents one of the Group's 
greatest strengths. 
37% of our employees are women. 
Our employees come from over 182 
nationalities in 141 countries. The ave-
rage age of our employees is 39 years. 
The average seniority in the Group is 
6 years.
RAISING AWARENESS 
AND LISTENING TO 
OUR EMPLOYEES 
2021 was characterised by the launch 
of a Group-wide diversity and inclusion 
awareness campaign and the imple-
mentation of pilot surveys to improve 
our ability to listen to our employees 
and make progress in our overall 
approach. 
For the first time, all employees were 
asked to attend mandatory training 
and to share their knowledge and best 
practices on the following topics: pre-
venting discrimination and promoting 
diversity; preventing harassment; ethics 
and compliance. 
This offer will be enriched in 2022 
with the launch of training courses 
and videos to raise awareness of 
unconscious bias. Aimed at recruiters 
and managers, it will help in the process 
of objective selection of candidates to 
promote diversity. The C-Box Diversity 
is now available in digital format and 
offers a module to learn how to detect 
possible forms of discrimination and 
plan actions within teams to promote 
diversity.
To measure the level of inclusion felt 
by our employees and to identify areas 
for improvement, a Diversity and Inclu-
sion survey will be conducted in CEVA 
Logistics Latin America (6,968 respon-
dents) and CMA CGM East Cost South 
America (487 respondents) in 2021.
We are aware of the importance of 
recruitment to the success of our 
diversity policy. This is why the Group 
ensures a high degree of diversification 
in the recruitment of interns and work-
study students at the head office, both 
in terms of choice of schools and loca-
tion, with local, national and internatio-
nal applications. 
CEVA, for its part, has made diversity 
and inclusion the focus of its employer 
brand in 2021:
- 
With the creation of a dedicated D&I 
web page on its new Careers site and 
by expressing its positioning to future 
candidates
-
 
Similarly, job advertisements are now 
written by diversity and inclusion stan-
dards in all regions.
In 2021, CEVA Logistics SEAPAC (South 
East Asia and Pacific) set up various 
initiatives in the form of animations 
and actions to raise awareness about 
diversity. These include an introduc-
tory workshop on sign language and a 
mobilisation for diversity month.
CEVA Logistics North America chose

mote gender equality. The intention 
is to promote the essential place of 
women in our Group through the imple-
mentation of programmes aimed at 
encouraging the promotion of women 
to strategic positions.

The gender equality index 
(France)
The Gender Pay Index assesses the 
differences in pay between women and 
men through several indicators: the pay 
gap, the increase and promotion gap, 
increases after maternity leave, and 
the percentage of women in the ten 
highest-paid positions. In 2021, for the 
equality index, CEVA Logistics Head 
Office scored 79/100 and CMA CGM 
France scored 84/100.
FOR INTERGENERA-
TIONAL DIVERSITY
The intergenerational approach is an 
enriching experience and provides a 
strong sense of complementarity wit-
hin the teams.  It is strongly encouraged 
within the Group.
CMA CGM Scandinavia has developed 
an intergenerational project within the 
company. Before the Covid-19 pan-
demic containment, workshops were 
held with young people on the contri-
bution of Generation Y to the trans-
port business. In 2022, workshops for 
senior citizens will be set up to promote 
intergenerational links and launch a 
mentoring programme.
2022 goals and 
ambitions 
In 2022, in terms 
of diversity and 
inclusion, we will 
commit to:
- Continue our efforts 
with awareness-
raising programmes 
for management 
teams and all 
employees. 
- Systematically 
include the diversity 
dimension in our 
human resources 
programmes and 
tools. 
- Conduct an internal 
and external 
communication 
campaign to promote 
women's careers 
within the Group 
and in our business 
sectors.
#We Are Shipping 
programme (Lebanon)
Initiated by Executive Vice President and 
President of the CMA CGM Foundation 
Tanya Saadé Zeenny, aims to advance 
women's leadership within the Group. 
In 2021, 16 CMA CGM employees from 
the millennial generation were accom-
panied in Beirut in their professional 
careers. #We Are Shipping acts as a 
career booster. Participants have the 
opportunity to receive leadership trai-
ning, benefit from networking sessions 
and share their experiences.

Through the actions of the CMA CGM Foundation and the Group's 
solidarity initiatives, we are committed to local communities. We 
encourage employees to contribute to and support our collective 
commitment and to share the Group's values. 
Despite the difficult health situation in 
2021, our employees around the world 
have mobilised massively in favour of 
local communities or territories.
A total of 289 actions were identified in 
100 countries, thus achieving the goal of 
carrying out at least one action in 70% 
of the countries in which the Group is 
present.
By 2022, we aim to have 100% of the 
countries in which at least one local 
action is carried out with our employees.
OBJECTIVES
• 100% of countries where the Group is implanted launched at least one local initiative
We contribute to the socio-economic development of the countries in which we operate through: 
• The promotion of education for all with the CMA CGM Foundation.
• Solidarity actions organised by our CSR referents around the world and involving our employees.

 OBJECTIVES
"The social responsibility of our Group is reflected 
in the two priorities of the CMA CGM Foundation: 
humanitarian aid and education for all. On the 
humanitarian front, we mobilise our industrial tools 
and expertise to support the actions of international 
NGOs such as UNICEF with the "containers of hope" 
programme. Concerning education, we directly 
support, or through our social incubator Le Phare, a 
large number of associations that work to improve 
access to school for children who are currently far 
from it.” 
TANYA SAADÉ-ZEENNY,  
 Executive Vice President and President 
of the CMA CGM Foundation
ACTING FOR PEOPLE
The CMA CGM Foundation supports 
associations developing educational 
projects and working to improve equal 
opportunities and access to education 
for all. To select the associations to sup-
port, the CMA CGM Foundation orga-
nises an annual call for projects. 
In 2021, the 9th edition of the CMA 
CGM Foundation's call for projects in 
France, which had as its theme "Encou-
raging innovation in the education of 
young people,” made it possible to 
support 18 associations and winning 
projects in the Marseille area, among 
the 126 applications received: Fonds 
de Dotation Pro Bono Lab, Amitiés 
Marseillaises Culture et Partage, École 
de la2e Chance, Réseau Môm'Artre, La 
Plateforme, ARI - Association Régionale 
pour l'Intégration, Association Coup de 
Pouce, Fondation Apprentis d'Auteuil, 
Association Départ (partner of Refugee 
Food), Ambition Cité, Each One for 
Society, Marsatac School, Mouvement 
UP (a member of the SOS Group), Sim-
plon.co, Bel Endroit pour une Ren-
contre, Le Rocher Oasis des Cités, Unis-
Cité Méditerranée and Fédération Léo 
Lagrange.
Exceptional grants were given to:
- Marseille Capitale de la Mer: through 
the operation "Un pas vers la mer" 
(A step towards the sea), 160 children 
aged between 6 and 14 were able to 
take part in swimming lessons at the 
Cercle des Nageurs in July. The pro-
gramme also included workshops to 
raise awareness of the marine environ-
ment, its biodiversity and its protection.
-Arts & Développement: multi-annual 
support for a new artistic activity centre 
and the development of a parents' 
space in the context of the artistic prac-
tice workshops run by the association. 
04.1 Supporting access to 
education for all 
- Transat Jacques Vabre: As part of its 
partnership with the Transat Jacques 
Vabre, the CMA CGM Foundation has 
highlighted its communication mate-
rials and supported the NGO Biblio-
thèques Sans Frontières, which works 
to improve access to culture and edu-
cation for the most vulnerable. 
In Marseille, the CMA CGM Foundation 
took part in the "Match of Heroes" with 
UNICEF. The charity football match at 
the Orange Velodrome raised funds 
to support UNICEF's Conceptos Plas-
ticos programme in Côte d'Ivoire. 
This programme builds schools made 
from recycled plastic waste bricks and 
ensures better education for Ivorian’s 
children. 
In Lebanon, the 2021 call for projects 
has been reoriented towards emer-
gency aid with the implementation of 
programmes designed and managed 
by the Foundation in partnership with 
recognised local NGOs. 
The Foundation has entered into a 
partnership with the NGO Beit El 
Baraka to contribute to the "FORSA" 
programme, which aims to address the 
difficulty many families have in paying 
their children's school fees and to fight 
against school drop-out. The Founda-
tion's support will help pay the school 
fees of 2,600 students in 17 schools 
throughout the country.

Fully committed to education for all, the 
CMA CGM Foundation has currently 
supported nearly 350 projects in France 
and Lebanon, helping tens of thousands 
of children.
In addition, to support populations 
affected by humanitarian crises in many 
countries around the world, the Foun-
dation has been developing a humani-
tarian transport programme, Contai-
ners of Hope, every year since 2012 in 
partnership with specialist NGOs and 
international organisations. Through 
Containers of Hope, the CMA CGM 
Foundation  provides these emergency 
aid specialists with the basic equipment 
they need to carry out their work in the 
field free of charge.

Crisis and Support Centre of the French 
Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs 
to transport humanitarian and relief 
supplies free of charge onboard the 
Group's ships. 
Nearly 1,700 containers representing 
15,000 tonnes of material have been 
transported to 40 countries since the 
operation was launched in 2012, inclu-
ding 530 Containers of Hope in 2021, 
mainly in Africa.
In 2021, UNICEF joined the Contai-
ners of Hope programme and bene-
fited from the donated shipment of 
201 containers to deliver educational 
materials, as well as pharmaceutical and 
nutritional products:
- 144 containers of school books for 
Chad. 
- 54 containers of therapeutic food and 
school supplies for Yemen. 
- 3 containers for the reconstruction of 
the Quarantine Hospital in Beirut.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the Foundation helped to deliver medi-
cal equipment around the world:
- In May 2021, a first humanitarian air 
operation to India mobilised an air-
craft from CMA CGM AIR CARGO fleet 
to transport 8 oxygen units and venti-
lators. 
- In June 2021, a maritime operation 
to Tunisia resulted in the delivery of 60 
containers representing 55 tonnes of 
medical equipment to Tunisian hospi-
tals. 
A humanitarian boat for 
Lebanon
Ever since the explosion in the port of 
Beirut on August 4, 2020, the situation 
in Lebanon has continued to deterio-
rate, exposing a growing proportion 
of its population to great insecurity. In 
this context, the CMA CGM Foundation 
was more active than ever in supporting 
the Lebanese population by relying on 
the industrial tool and expertise of CMA 
CGM Group employees as well as on 
international NGOs present in Lebanon.
- 
In February 2021: the CMA CGM Foun-
dation organised the purchase, trans-
port by sea and distribution by land of 
nearly 600,000 pieces of personal pro-
tective equipment and 20 breathing 
apparatus to meet the needs of the 
resuscitation and emergency depart-
ments of Lebanese hospitals.
ACTING FOR PEOPLE
04 - Supporting local communities
- In June 2021, in response to a shortage 
of infant formula and to support fami-
lies who could no longer meet the nutri-
tional needs of their young children, the 
CMA CGM Foundation purchased and 
shipped 4,000 boxes of infant formula, 
equivalent to 7 tonnes, as well as 10,000 
pieces of infant formula donated by the 
French company Danone. These pro-
ducts were distributed to more than 
1,000 children through 9 Lebanese 
NGOs.
- In July 2021, inflation has made many 
essential products inaccessible, a CMA 
CGM Group vessel was once again 
mobilised to transport 136 tonnes of 
medicines, medical equipment and 
infant formula free of charge to 10 
NGOs and 3 Lebanese hospitals. 
CMA CGM Foundation supported 
associations organising collections and 
equipment purchases for recognised 
Lebanese NGOs by reserving space on 
board CMA CGM ships. More than 150 
humanitarian containers were shipped 
to Beirut free of charge as part of the 
Containers of Hope programme for the 
benefit of over 40 Lebanese NGOs and 
hospitals. 
NATURAL DISASTER 
SUPPORT
Global warming is increasing the fre-
quency and intensity of natural disas-
ters that affect people around the 
world. Whenever possible, CMA CGM 
Group mobilises its resources and skills 
to mitigate the dramatic consequences 
of these events for its employees, 
partners or the hard-hit populations.
The Group also supported the victims 
of natural disasters in Malaysia (floods), 
the Philippines (typhoon), Indonesia 
(volcanic eruption) and the United 
States (hurricane). These solidarity 
actions were carried out with the invol-
vement of employees: donations of 
necessities, non-perishable food items, 
financial and logistical involvement of 
the Group.
TRANSPORT OF 
ESSENTIAL GOODS BY 
CEVA LOGISTICS
CEVA Logistics has been involved in 
the transport of essential goods during 
major events:
-	 COVID-19: transport of vaccine 
doses to Pakistan and Uganda, trans-
port of oxygen concentrators to 
Indonesia
-	 Emergency transport of tents, medi-
cal equipment, medicines, etc. to help 
the population after Haiti earthquake 
-	 CEVA Logistics employees voluntee-
red in China to help flood victims in 
Zhengzhou
-	 In Thailand, voluntary distribution 
of school materials to students in diffi-
culty, in partnership with the Wellington 
College International School in Bang-
kok
-	 In Malaysia and Singapore, dona-
tions and delivery of food in electric 
vehicles 
LE PHARE, THE

Le Phare opened its doors in Sep-
tember 2021 to a first class of 7 entre-
preneurs: 4 Lab Educatif, Carbon Blue, 
École Buissonnière Lab, Permis de 
Rêve, Kipawa, Roxx Moda and Marseille 
Capitale de la Mer.
Le Phare is a 9-month support pro-
gramme for young entrepreneurs 
developing projects with a strong 
social impact in the field of education 
or professional integration. It includes 
a coworking space located at the Epo-
pée, an educational complex in the 
heart of Marseille's northern neighbou-
rhoods, customised training and pro-
fessional mentoring provided by CMA 
CGM employees involved in the skills 
sponsorship programme.
CULTURAL ACTION IN 
LEBANON
The Foundation supported the Baal-
beck Festival's "Musical Journey in 
the Roman Temples of the Bekaa" 
show which took place in July 2021. 
This support aims to promote young 
Lebanese artists and the cultural 
influence of Lebanon.
BLOOD DONATION  
Throughout the year, the Group's 
employees donate their time to save 
lives. More than 750 people took part 
in a blood donation campaign orga-
nised at their workplace, in close coo-
peration with local associations.
Some countries have gone even 
further by raising awareness of 
bone marrow donation among their 
employees. Although it offers hope 
for a cure to people with cancer or 
blood diseases, this little-known 
donation is lacking in many parts of 
the world. After an information cam-
paign in Poland, 15 employees of 
CEVA Logistics voluntarily donated 
their bone marrow.

SOLIDARITY DURING 
THE FESTIVE SEASON
As it does every year, CMA CGM Group, 
its Foundation and its employees have 
joined forces with local associations 
to make the end-of-year celebrations 
a time for sharing. Several initiatives 
have been launched to help the most 
disadvantaged, in partnership with 
recognised NGOs, notably through 
food banks, the collection of toys or 
blankets and warm clothing. With the 
mobilisation of the Group's subsidia-
ries, its network of agencies and more 
than 1,200 employees, this commit-
ment to solidarity has taken on a glo-
bal dimension. In 2021, 37 actions have 
been carried out in about 30 different 
countries.
At the end of 2021, after a year still 
marked by the pandemic and its social 
consequences, the CMA CGM Founda-
tion mobilised alongside associations 
to implement solidarity actions in Mar-
seille and Lebanon for the end-of-year 
celebrations:
In Marseille:
- In December, a solidarity collection 
was organised for employees in Mar-
seille. The donations collected made it 
possible to gather 171 kg of foodstuffs, 
i.e. the equivalent of 342 meals for the 
benefit of the Bouches-du-Rhône Food 
Bank. In addition, a hundred children 
will be able to benefit from the school 
supplies collected for the association 
Ecole au Présent, which works to pro-
vide schooling for children living in 
extremely precarious situations.
-The CMA CGM Foundation has 
donated refurbished laptops: 60 for 
Emmaüs Connect to facilitate digital 
access for all, 6 to equip the computer 
room of the Ambition Cité association 
and 4 for deserving students from a 
school located in the Félix Pyat housing 
estate in Marseille.
-The CMA CGM Foundation supported 
the Restaurant Le République by pro-
viding 200 solidarity meals prepared 
on December 24 and 25 for people in 
precarious situations.
The end of the year was also an oppor-
tunity to highlight the UN agency 
UNICEF, and to look back on the first 
year of partnership with the CMA CGM 
Foundation as part of the Containers of 
Hope operation through the organisa-
tion in Marseille of a photo exhibition 
and a solidarity sale to benefit UNICEF.
Lebanon:
In December, a major food operation 
purchased, prepared and distributed 
5,600 food parcels for vulnerable 
Lebanese families.  Thanks to the 
mobilisation of CMA CGM employees 
and CEVA Logistics in Lebanon, and in 
partnership with 26 Lebanese NGOs, 
distribution operations were organised 
throughout the country. 
In the United States:
35,000 Americans were helped by 
CMA CGM Group during the Thanks-
giving holiday through food donations. 
Between November 13 and 23, 2021, 
12,000 turkeys were distributed to fami-
lies in need across seven cities in the 
United States: Los Angeles, Washing-
ton, Nashville, Wilmington, Houston, 
Norfolk and Savannah. 310 volunteer 
employees took part in the operation.
INVOLVING 
EMPLOYEES 
IN DONATION 
CAMPAIGNS
Every year within the Group many 
donation campaigns are organised 
for the benefit of local communities.
In Latin America: 
CEVA Logistics has set up the "A 
cap for a smile”operation with the 
" Angelitos de cristal " association. 
The collection and resale of plastic 
caps support this association which 
works for children suffering from epi-
dermolysis bullosa.
In the Netherlands: 
CEVA Logistic s has organised 
two donation campaigns for its 
employees:
-	 Collection of plastic bottles and 
resale to help the association "Stich-
ting ALS Nederland " which works for 
people with myotrophic lateral scle-
rosis: 1,700 euros were collected.
-	 A raffle was organised with the 
proceeds going to the North Limburg 
Food Bank: 2000 euros were collected 
and the initiative will be renewed

education for all 
its priority. It is 
committed to 
helping children 
and young people 
around the world 
find their place 
in tomorrow's 
world thanks to 
education. 
SKILLS SPONSORSHIP
Volunteers contribute their time and 
expertise to strengthen the impact of 
the Foundation's actions and those of 
its partner associations. In 2022, skills-
based sponsorship will be extended to 
the entire Group. The following tasks 
were carried out in 2021: 
-4 employees involved in the study of 
the Foundation's call for projects.
- 23 employees involved in supporting 
the entrepreneurs of the Le Phare social 
incubator. 
- 16 employees involved in the Founda-
tion's partner associations that have an 
educational mission in the Marseille area. 
- 6 experts from CMA CGM's Ree-
fer division were hired to advise the 
UNICEF Supply Division on the mari-
time transport of refrigerated products. 
PLANET WEEK 
CMA CGM's Planet Week is the largest 
internal event of the year dedicated to 
sustainable development. It was held 
between the 12th and 14th of October 
2021, at the head office in Marseille, 
where the entire ecosysteme of diffe-
rent experts in environment, engaged 
clients and partners in CSR and also 
Comex members gathered to talk about 
our CSR policy in order to inform the col-
laborators and reinforce their mobilisa-
tion.  More than 12,000 employees from 
all over the world were able to follow the 
three days live event.
This was an opportunity to highlight 12 
local projects supported by the Group, 
in 12 countries, on the topics of biodi-
versity, climate change and sustainable 
development awareness.
My CMA CGM Group Daily Impact  is an 
awareness and mobilisation program for 
all CMA CGM Group collaborators. The 
aim of this project is to raise awareness 
on how we can reduce our individual 
environmental impact. This programme 
offers training to better understand 
climate issues, a personalised tool to 
assess one's carbon footprint and indi-
vidual and collective challenges to limit 
one's impact. Each challenge will raise 
funds for associations and organisations 
involved in the preservation of the envi-
ronment. A pilot phase was launched 
in October 2021, with 400 volunteers 
from the Group. The programme will be 
open to all Group employees in 2022. 
This platform combines the pedagogi-
cal approach of WeNow, a startup for 
awareness-raising and training on cli-
mate issues, with mao boa specialised in 
collaborators' engagement for the sus-
tainable development, launched within 
our ZeBox startup incubator.

THE CSR NETWORK'S 
MOBILISATION
The CSR network is mobilised 
throughout the year to the rhythm of the 
UN's international days and thus stren-
gthens the commitment of all employees 
throughout the world. 
On April 22, 2021, Earth Day was cele-
brated in the network:
- At headquarters, our employees and 
management participated in a webinar 
to raise awareness of the challenges of 
sustainable development. It took place 
through our partnership with Earthwake, 
a French NGO protecting the seas and 
oceans by converting plastic waste into 
energy using cutting-edge technology. 
-	 In the Senegal Cluster, the teams par-
ticipated in a webinar on plastic pollution. 
External speakers made them aware of 
this major issue in the region and shared 
examples of good practices to adopt. 
- On June 5, 2021, on World Environment 
Day, local waste collection actions were 
carried out throughout the network (36 
countries)
- In Guadeloupe, a week of aware-
ness-raising on environmental issues was 
organised for all employees: webinars, 
conferences, exhibitions, challenges for 
greener offices and the planting of 200 
trees enlivened this week rich in learning 
and commitment. 
World Clean Up Day was celebrated on 
September 18, 2021. As in previous years, 
CMA CGM Group and its employees 
have mobilised everywhere they are 
present to participate in the collection 
of waste and the fight against pollution 
- taking into account the restrictions asso-
ciated with COVID-19.
- 1,900 employees in 84 countries collec-
ted over 15,000 kg of waste. 
- In Gabon, for example, 20 employees 
brought together friends and family to 
collect more than 280 kilos of waste on 
the beach in Libreville in just a few hours, 
with the NGO "La Marche pro".
- Employees in Marseille took part 
in several clean-up operations in the 
Calanques National Park, of which the 
Group is a partner. The initiative was car-
ried out in association with the Goutte 
bleue (a Marseilles-based NGO, which 
received the "
Janus du Design Civique", a 
label from the French Institute of Design).
- In countries such as Asia where these 
operations were not allowed due to 
health restrictions, digital clean-ups were 
organised, notably allowing the deletion 
of 10,000 GigaBytes of emails, which is 
9 times the distance between Paris and 
New York AR. 
In addition to the benefits for the pla-
net, this event enabled us to unite all our 
employees around the same cause, at the 
same time, and to raise their awareness of 
the environmental issues for which we are 
all agents of change.
In 2021, thanks to skills sponsorship, 
more than 96 CMA CGM Group employees 
in France and Lebanon were able to 
invest up to 5 days per year during their 
working hours for the benefit of partner 
associations of the CMA CGM Foundation.

IN 2021, CMA CGM GROUP CONTINUED 
TO EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN THE 
APPLICATION OF THIS LAW WITHIN THE 
GROUP AND IN ITS ACTIVITIES AND 
SUBSIDIARIES. IN 2021, THE FOLLOWING 
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE ON EACH OF 
THE FIVE MEASURES OF THE LAW:
1.
Risk mapping 
The Duty of Vigilance risk 
map has been updated in 
2021 according to Group 
methodology and its annual 
update.  
In parallel, risks relating 
to fundamental freedoms, 
health, safety and the 
environment are considered 
in all risk mappings (whether 
they be new or revised 
versions).
2.
Evaluation procedures
In addition, more than 14,000 suppliers and subcontractors were assessed 
through the Group's Accelerate programme. The Group has maintained its 
Platinum EcoVadis medal for 2021 and 2022, demonstrating its commitment 
to CSR and its actions in relation to the duty of care. The Group is also a 
member of the UN Global Compact and participates and discusses Duty of 
Care issues in several inter-professional groups.
5.
Monitoring of 
measures
A list of indicators has been 
put in place to monitor 
the implementation of all 
measures taken by the 
Group. These indicators are 
monitored and steered by 
the departments and teams 
concerned. 
3.
Appropriate 
actions
In 2021, several initiatives 
were launched to 
protect fundamental 
freedoms, fight against 
all forms of discrimination 
and improve working 
conditions, particularly 
in the context of the 
Covid-19 pandemic 
Important decisions have 
been taken and solutions 
have been implemented 
to protect the planet 
and limit global warming 
and the impact on 
biodiversity.
Ensuring respect for human 
rights in the value chain
This chapter is a summary of CMA CGM Group's 2021 Compliance 
Plan, available on the Group's corporate website. Detailed Group 
2021 vigilance plan is available here.
Adopted in 2017, French law on the duty of vigilance requires large 
companies and their subsidiaries to publish an annual vigilance 
plan to identify risks related to their activities and those of their 
subcontractors and suppliers, and to prevent serious violations of 
human rights, fundamental freedoms, human health and safety and 
the environment.
4.

Fighting against climate 
change
The transport sector and shipping account for 24% and 3% 
respectively of global greenhouse gas emissions. This is why 
CMA CGM aims to become a leader in low-carbon transport 
solutions across the entire transport value chain (sea, logistics 
and air).
In the context of COP 26, CMA CGM Group has joined the global 
"Race to Zero" campaign and is committed to achieving a net 
zero carbon target by 2050 at the latest.
Supplying dual fuel gas vessels is a major step in the fleet's 
energy transition. By 2024, our fleet will have at least 44 
LNG-powered vessels. This new equipment will enable the 
use of renewable energies to propel our vessels (gases 
such as biomethane and synthetic methane). To make this 
decarbonization strategy a reality, the Group is also investing 
in the production of biomethane and setting up strategic 
partnerships with its suppliers.
Convinced that decarbonization of the Group requires a mix of 
solutions, we are investing in research and development (R&D) 
to design the clean vessels of the future and are working to 
continuously improve the performance of our assets.

GROUP MARITIME 
CO2 EMISSIONS
In 2021, the CMA CGM fleet emitted 
25,42million tons of CO2, an increase 
of 9% compared to 2020. At the same 
time, operational performance slightly 
increased from 52 g CO2/TEU-km  in 
2020 to 53 g CO2/TEU-km  in 2021.
The increase in emissions in 2021 is the-
refore not linked to a minor degrada-
tion of  the performance of the Group's 
fleet but is due to the cyclical rebound 
inactivity after the health crisis in 2020. 
Thus, the additional emissions are 
explained by:
–	 

Heavy global congestion in ports 
requiring adjustments in the organi-
sation of our vessel fleet (repositio-
ning of certain vessels on different 
maritime services, numerous fleet 
phase in and phase out  to adapt to 
our customers' demand, accelera-
tions to make up for waiting times)
–	 
Cases of COVID-19 leading to the 
quarantine of vessels and then the 
need to put vessels back on sche-
dule and therefore increase speed
Since 2008, the Group has reduced 
its CO2 emissions by 48% (TEU-km) by 
investing in:
–	 

Newer, more energy-efficient ships 
equipped with the latest environ-
mentally friendly technologies;
–	 
Optimisation of the use of the ves-
sel fleet by developing alliances with 
partners;
–	 
A better thought-out fleet operation 
policy that contributes to energy 
savings 
CO2 emissions per container trans-
ported increased by 3%compared to 
2020, to 1,15 tonnes of CO2/TEU trans-
ported.

CMA CGM GROUP 
OBJECTIVE IS TO 
ACHIEVE NET-ZERO 
BY 2050
At COP26, CMA CGM Group took ano-
ther step towards decarbonisation by 
announcing its decision to join the Race 
to Zero, an initiative supported by the 
United Nations Global Compact. With 
this commitment, we are going beyond 
carbon neutrality and are now aiming 
for Net Zero by 2050. Net-Zero goes 
beyond carbon neutrality by focusing 
on emission reductions rather than off-
setting.
CMA CGM Group aims to define its 
precise decarbonisation trajectory 
between 2021 and 2050 within the next 
two years, in line with the Paris agree-
ments and the 1.5°C whose objective 
is to limit the increase of the average 
temperature using the "Science-Based 
Targets" methodology. 
This represents a more ambitious com-
mitment by Rodolphe SAADE, Chair-
man and CEO of CMA CGM Group, 
following the announcement made in 
June 2020 to achieve carbon neutrality 
by 2050.
As part of this commitment, the Group 
has decided to include its GHG emis-
sions in its key performance indicators 
in accordance with the SBTi standard. 
For 2021, this represents 30.5 million 
tonnes of CO2 eq.
The Group also participated in the wor-
king group launched by the Science-
Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for the 
development of sectoral trajectories for 
the maritime sector, bringing together 
several maritime companies.
CMA CGM Group took an active part in 
COP26, notably through the participa-
tion of its experts in the days dedicated 
to energy, the ocean and transport.
DOING EVERYTHING 
POSSIBLE TO  
ACHIEVE A 
SIGNIFICANT AND 
SUSTAINABLE 
REDUCTION IN  
OUR EMISSIONS 
The Group's decarbonisation roadmap 
is driven by the Group's commitments, 
the regulatory timetable and client 
demands. 
Our path to decarbonising the activity 
of marine transport is based on three 
pillars: 
– 
New energies for propulsion (LNG, 
biomethane, synthetic methane, 
e-methane and biodiesel)
– 
State-of-the-art ships in terms of both 
fuel efficiency and design.
– 
Operational excellence daily for all 
our material assets.
LIQUEFIED NATURAL 
GAS, AN INITIAL 
RESPONSE TO THE 
CHALLENGE OF 
FIGHTING CLIMATE 
CHANGE
To make an immediate and signi-
ficant contribution to the sector's 
energy transition, CMA CGM Group 
made the pioneering choice in 2017 
to use liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
We are preparing the future of a maritime 
transport sector where economic 
competitiveness and growth will go hand 
in hand with Sustainable Development and 
the fight against climate change [...] and we 
will go even further to make it even more 
environmentally friendly.
« 
Our fleet of gas-powered vessels is a first step towards 
the decarbonisation of maritime transport, but 
we are also preparing  the future with significant 
investments in R&D with a focus on biofuels and 
synthetic fuels for our vessels. At the same time, 
we are making progress on other alternative 
energies such as electricity and green hydrogen 
for our other needs (quay equipment, cranes or 
machinery). New technologies will also allow us 
to optimise our operations and thus reduce our 
consumption to a minimum. We already do this 
with the help of algorithms that allow us to adapt 
the route of our ships or optimise their loading. To 
limit our consumption, we also invest significantly 
in the engineering of our ships. We are developing 
innovative designs that will take to the sea in a few 
months. »
CHRISTINE CABAU WOEHREL, 
Executive Vice President Operations  
and Assets
propulsion, designed specifically 
for this energy. This energy offers 
the advantage of being immedia-
tely available, with major benefits for 
the environment and air quality. The 
environmental performance achie-
ved with LNG exceeds current regu-
latory requirements for air pollutants.
This choice has therefore enabled 
significant progress and a first step 
towards the decarbonisation of 
the Group's activities by reducing 
the main atmospheric pollutants. 
This technology also makes it pos-
sible to prepare for the conversion of 
the fleet. Thus, the engine deployed 
on these ships is already technically 
capable of using biomethane, as 
well as synthetic methane (instead 
of LNG), new-generation fuels that 
make it possible to approach carbon 
neutrality. This "e-methane ready" 
fleet currently consists of 23 vessels 
already in service and will include at 
least 44 vessels by the end of 2024. 
From 2022, LNG ships will run on 
100% LNG or new generation fuels. 
CMA CGM is currently developing an 
excellent LNG industry, particularly 
in the port of Marseille-Fos, which 
will enable it to refuel its ships sai-
ling between Asia and the Mediter-
ranean. The next stage will see the 
gradual substitution of fossil LNG with 
methane from renewable sources.

BIOMETHANE/
SYNTHETIC 
METHANES
By choosing LNG to power its new 
ships, CMA CGM Group is paving 
the way for biomethane.  After the 
first LNG bunkering of CMA CGM 
JACQUES SAADE in Rotterdam in 
2020, supplemented by the pur-
chase of 1,000 tonnes of biomethane 
as a guarantee of origin , the use of 
biomethane has been strengthe-
ned in 2021 with the purchase of an 
additional 22 000  tons represen-
ting a reduction of  approximately 
 
60 000 tons of CO2
2.
Supporting the development 
of the biomethane sector 
through partnerships
To accelerate the development 
of biomethane, the Group is com-
mitted to supporting the produc-
tion sector. CMA CGM Group has 
(1) Biogas guarantee of origin: the guarantee of 
origin is a certificate that allows its owner to swap the 
carbon footprint of the fossil LNG he consumes with 
that of biomethane injected into the gas network.
(2) Reduction of CO2 emissions linked to the purchase 
of biomethane through guarantees of origin in 
comparison with LNG use

 OBJECTIVE
invested in WAGA ENERGY, a com-
pany that builds and operates inno-
vative landfill gas purification units 
produced from organic waste. Once 
processed, this gas can be injected 
into the grid or used as fuel. 
CMA CGM Group has also esta-
blished a long-term strategic and 
industrial cooperation with ENGIE 
for the production of low-carbon 
fuels. The goal is to :
–	 

Promote industrial production and 
distribution of synthetic methane 
and bio-LNG from which maritime 
transport could benefit.
–	 

Initiate projects for the produc-
tion of synthetic methane on an 
industrial scale.
–	 

Share expertise and R&D to faci-
litate the development of tomor-
row's energies.
Industrial projects for the produc-
tion of synthetic methane, led by 
ENGIE and in which CMA CGM will 
be able to invest, notably in the 
form of multi-year purchase com-
mitments, are being prepared using 
different technologies (pyrogasifi-
cation or methanation using green 
hydrogen and captured CO2).
The Group is committed to the local 
ecological transition and the circular 
economy by developing partnerships 
with local players such as EveRé and 
the Grand Port of Marseille. This 
partnership consists of valorising the 
gas produced from the biodegradable 
household waste of the Marseille Pro-
vence area by supplying LNG-powe-
red ships, in particular those of CMA 
CGM Group. This project benefits 
from particularly suitable existing 
infrastructures within the Grand Port 
Maritime: EveRé's waste methani-
sation units, Elengy's LNG terminals 
- which will enable the storage and 
delivery of this BioGNL, TotalEnergies' 
bunker ship which will be present in 
the port from January 2022, and CMA 
CGM Group's fleet of LNG powered 
ships. A feasibility study has been 
launched for this large-scale project, 
which should be part of the natio-
nal approach to supporting BioGNL 
defined in the law on the orientation 
of mobility.
The transition to the physical supply 
of biomethane has already begun. 
CMA CGM Group have conducted 
the first Bio-LNG bunkering trial. The 
CONTAINERSHIPS AURORA, a 1,400 
TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) 
LNG-powered vessel, was bunkered 
by Shell with a blend of almost 10% 
Bio-GNL during a port call in Rot-
terdam in the summer of 2021. 
The operation was completed by 
means of a ship-to-ship transfer while 
the CONTAINERSHIPS AURORA 
continued its port handling opera-
tions simultaneously, thus keeping to 
the planned schedule.
As part of the Smart Port Challenge 
organised by the Grand Port of Mar-
seille, the start-up Synchronicity and 
CMA CGM Group have carried out a 
feasibility study for the construction 
of a biomethane production unit in 
the port of Marseille-Fos. This pro-
ject is part of the Group's desire to 
develop and structure a local industry 
of excellence around LNG, bio-me-
thane and, in the future, e-methane. 
After a precise inventory of the orga-
nic resources that Synchronicity could 
mobilise, the study concluded that 
the economic model for a biome-
thane production unit in the GPMM 
was viable and reproducible. The 
bio-methane production unit will 
therefore make it possible to refuel 
the company's ships cost-effectively 
while serving the ecological issue and 
contributing to the reduction of its 
greenhouse gas emissions.
SECOND-
GENERATION 
BIOFUEL
In addition to the development of LNG 
and its renewable derivatives, in 2019 
we initiated the use of second-genera-
tion biofuels with which our ships have 
travelled one million kilometres. This 
biofuel, made from used cooking oil, 
reduces GHGs by 85% from extraction 
to combustion. 
The Group has chosen to adopt a res-
ponsible purchasing policy for biofuels. 
The biomethane and biodiesel supplied 
by the group are produced exclusively 
from organic waste. These criteria ensure 
that biofuels do not compete with food 
and that they significantly reduce green-
house gas emissions.
The second-generation biofuels avai-
lable today are also intended for use in 
road transport and aviation. CMA CGM 
Group, as part of the Coalition for Future 
Energy in Transport and Logistics, is wor-
king with its partners to create a sustai-
nable marine fuel with properties suitable 
for ship engines and cheaper to produce.

STRUCTURING R&D 
FOR ZERO-EMISSION 
SHIPS
Several technical solutions with 
promising prospects are currently 
being studied. CMA CGM Group is 
working in several areas: 
–	 
Reducing the consumption and 
emissions of ships by making them 
as efficient as possible (optimising 
shapes and operations, installing 
aerodynamic fairings, digitalising 
ships, inspection drones).
–	 
To use decarbonized fuels such as 
e-methane, a fuel produced from 
green hydrogen, or take advan-
tage of wind power, which reduces 
fuel consumption.
–	 
Limiting greenhouse gas emis-
sions by treating exhaust gases 
with carbon capture or methane 
leakage reduction processes.
CMA CGM Group is investing in R&D 
to adapt these solutions to large 
container ships as quickly as pos-
sible. The 25 people dedicated to 
these issues (naval engineers, data 
scientists) work together to promote 
innovation within the Group.
While the Group is committed to 
the promising use of biomethane 
and synthetic methane to decar-
bonise its business, other poten-
tial solutions continue to be stu-
died. For example, the Group is 
participating in an in-depth study 
by the Carbone 4 consultancy on 
the potential of hydrogen to limit 
greenhouse gas emissions in seve-
ral sectors, including maritime. The 
possibility of vehicle traction is also 
being considered and the Group 
is supporting a study by the Mar-
seille-based start-up Syroco, which 
is being supported by the ZEBOX 
company incubator. The capture 
and sequestration of CO2 is also the 
subject of extensive studies by the 
R&D department.
TOGETHER WITH 
ENERGY OBSERVER 
TO DEVELOP ZERO-
EMISSION SHIPS
CMA CGM Group has joined forces 
with Energy Observer - the first 
green hydrogen-powered ship to 
sail the world - to pursue a com-
mon goal: zero-emission shipping. 
The project's mission is to test and 
develop energy solutions based 
on hydrogen, solar, tidal and wind 
power.
CMA CGM Group will bring its indus-
trial expertise to this experimental 
vessel to promote the deployment 
of a hydrogen propulsion system for 
maritime transport, and in return will 
receive information on the new tech-
nology tested by Energy Observer in 
real conditions.
UNITING R&D 
EFFORTS AND 
PROMOTING 
CROSS-SECTORAL 
COOPERATION 
To significantly increase and pool 
investments aimed at reducing the 
carbon footprint of transport and 
logistics throughout the value chain, 
Rodolphe Saadé, CEO of CMA CGM 
Group, created an international coa-
lition in 2019 to develop the energies 
of tomorrow for transport and logis-
tics with the support of the French 
President. The aim is to promote 
the use of new energies, accelerate 
R&D in transport and determine 
future standards for reducing CO2 
emissions. It has 17 members and 
will welcome new members in 2022. 
Working on land, sea and air trans-
port modes, this coalition brings 
together 10 projects aimed at acce-
lerating the energy transition, the first 
deliverables of which were presented 
to the CEOs in summer 2021:  
–	 
The creation of a demonstrator to 
calculate the carbon footprint for 
door-to-door transport in order to 
identify the least polluting trans-
port solutions.  
–	 
The promotion and development 
of biomethane solutions for the 
maritime sector to reduce emis-
sions from the sector by at least 
67%, 
–	 
The launch of a new second-gene-
ration biofuel, dedicated to mari-
time transport,
–	 
A study on the impact of conver-
ting from fossil fuels to green 
electricity on an Asia-Europe 
axis, including the implementa-
tion of port electrification, shore 
power for ships, photovoltaics on 
the roofs of various logistics war-
ehouses, etc. 
–	 
Accelerating the development 
of hydrogen trucks in Europe in 
partnership with Supply Chain 4 
Goods Community via a collection 
of zero-emission truck purchase 
intentions,
–	 
The development of zero-emission 
solutions by combining maritime, 
land and air needs,
–	 
The conversion of port terminals 
into Green Hubs in partnership 
with the French Maritime Cluster,
–	 
A study on the various synthe-
tic fuels for the maritime sector 
(e-methanol, e-methane, ammo-
nia, green hydrogen, etc.),
–	 
The study of a new e-fuel for avia-
tion,
–	 
The definition of a future supply 
chain for the industry.

OPTIMISED,  
STATE-OF-THE-ART 
SHIPS
The Group has undertaken a number 
of actions to reduce its fuel consump-
tion and therefore its GHG emissions: 
fleet renewal, technical modifications 
to vessels, monitoring of consump-
tion, speed reduction, optimisation 
 
of vessel routes, technical impro-
vements relating to propulsion and 
hydrodynamics. 
Several years ago, CMA CGM initiated 
a programme to optimise its owned 
fleet, notably by modifying the bul-
bous bows and propellers.  Carried 
out in dry dock, these changes make 
it possible to optimise the hydrody-
namics of the vessels at the speeds 
used and to generate fuel savings 
and consequently CO2 emissions of 5% 
 
to 10%. 
In 2018, the Group launched a pro-
gramme to equip auxiliary engines 
with recovery boilers (as with the main 
engine). Instead of burning hydrocar-
bons to produce the steam needed 
to run the ship, the boiler will recover 
heat from the exhaust fumes of the 
auxiliary engines, even when the main 
engine is not running.
CMA CGM takes a long-term view 
of its new buildings to ensure maxi-
mum adaptability in a rapidly chan-
ging regulatory environment. This 
translates into a disruptive hull 
design, state-of-the-art aerodyna-
mic superstructures and e-fuel ready 
engines. All of these innovations 
make it possible to exceed IMO cri-
teria such as EEDI (Energy Efficiency 
Design Index).  
HOW DO  
WE OPERATE  
OUR ASSETS?
In this global optimisation plan, it 
is necessary to consider how CMA 
CGM Group operates its assets.
In the maritime segment, reducing 
emissions in the context of conges-
tion in 2021 is a real challenge: ope-
rational excellence is increasingly 
important as a lever for improving 
CO2 performance.
3 fleet centers covering all time zones 
are manned 24/7 by Group seafarers 
seconded ashore. Their mission is to 
assist ships and perform intelligent 
maritime routing that minimises fuel 
consumption.  They define the best 
route for each of the Group's vessels 
and provide optimised weather assis-
tance in real-time. They work in close 
collaboration with the Operations 
Department, which optimises all of 
the Group's operations (nautical and 
operational management of vessels, 
reduction of port congestion, opti-
misation of CMA CGM maritime and 
land network).  
A partnership with a start-up (Notilo) 
from our incubator ZEBOX has been 
created. Using artificial intelligence, 
inspections of ship hulls are carried 
out to develop better hydrodyna-
mics.
The Group has signed an innovative 
five-year partnership with the Centre 
National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) 
to work on connected and intelligent 
port routing and operations.
The Group is also working to opti-
mise its logistics network, in particu-
lar through the use of data and arti-
ficial intelligence. A large-scale data 
collection and analysis programme 
is being developed on the maritime 
side to improve the performance of 
our vessels, knowledge of energy on 
board, trajectory and speed supervi-
sion, identification of over-consump-
tion and bunkering optimisation. 
 
50 ships will be connected by the end 
of 2022.
Digital technologies are a power-
ful lever to address several major 
challenges in maritime transport 
and logistics and to reduce their envi-
ronmental footprint. All the refrige-
rated containers in the Group's fleet 
are already equipped with energy 
consumption management sof-
tware to monitor the temperature 
of goods as closely as possible and 
avoid waste.   
REGULATORY ISSUES
The international maritime 
organisation
In April 2018, the IMO adopted its ini-
tial strategy for reducing GHG emis-
sions from ships in line with the Paris 
Agreement. This strategy contains 3 
levels of ambition 
–	 
Implementation of new EEDI 
phases, energy efficiency requi-
rements for new ships (built since 
2013) 
–	 
Reduction of CO2 emissions per 
transport unit by 40% in 2030 and 
70% in 2050, compared to 2008.
–	 
Reduction of total GHG emissions 
by 50% in 2050, compared to 2008.
The strategy is due to be reviewed in 
2023. The first set of short-term mea-
sures was approved in June 2021 for 
implementation in 2023. 
The IMO has adopted goal-based 
measures, such as the EEXI  (Energy 
Efficiency Existing Ship Index) and 
the CII   (Carbon Intensity Indica-
tor), which will be implemented from 
January 1st, 2023.
In addition, IMO adopted amend-
ments to EEDI phase 3 for contai-
nerships : At MEPC 75, it has been 
decided to strengthened the reduc-
tion rate (based on ship size) and to 
move the implementation date from 
2025 to 2022. . The creation of Phase 4 
is currently being discussed in a spe-
cialised IMO Working Group.
As a response to the IMO's short-term 
measures, CMA CGM Group has set 
up a programme entitled Roadmap 
2023/2030, which is supported by a 
dedicated cross-functional internal 
working team. This "cross-functio-
nal" team includes nineteen people 
from various departments: energy, 
chartering, operational management, 
lines, R&D, etc. Its members have 
been working since the beginning of 
2021 on evaluating the performance 
of each vessel and improving or repla-
cing the least efficient vessels in order 
to ensure compliance with the regula-
tions to come in 2023. The progress of 
this working group is presented quar-
terly to the CEO Rodolphe Saadé.
The Group also calls for measures to 
reduce the negative climate externali-
ties of maritime transport while using 
market mechanisms. It is indeed 
essential to preserve the sector's 
capacity to facilitate international 
trade, according to responsible cri-
teria. In this perspective, CMA CGM 
considers the adoption of a carbon 
trading system, applied on a global 
basis to maritime carriers, as a key 
long-term objective. This requires 
greater coherence between Europe's 
regional and IMO's international 
agendas and measures.

The european green deal  
In December 2019, the European 
Commission presented its Green 
Deal for Europe: a roadmap with the 
goal of climate neutrality by 2050. In 
December 2020, it also published its 
Sustainable and Intelligent Mobility 
Strategy, with an action plan of 82 
measures, many of which target the 
maritime transport sector. 
On 14 July 2021, the "fit for 55" the 
EU published “fit for 55” package. It 
contains 12 legislatives proposals to 
make the EU's policies fit for redu-
cing GHG emissions by at least 55% 
by 2030 compared to 1990. 
Two main initiatives would impact 
the maritime sector. The first is 
the inclusion of shipping in the EU 
Emissions Trading System (ETS) by 
2023. The phasing in would take 
place progressively between 2023 
and 2026 leading to the shipping 
sector paying for 100% of its emis-
sions in 2026. The second is the esta-
blishment of a new initiative called 
FuelEU Maritime. FuelEU maritime 
would include two major measures: 
firstly, targets for reducing the car-
bon intensity of energy used by ships 
to encourage the use of alternative 
fuels and, secondly, the obligation 
for all ships calling the EU to use 
shore power by 2030.  
In addition, the EU taxonomy, which 
is currently being finalised, will be 
an important benchmark for direc-
ting funding towards lower-emis-
sion activities. These new regula-
tions, while necessary in the current 
context, will most likely lead to 
changes in our customers' supply 
chain and the way we conduct our 
shipping operations.
TERMINALS
An energy audit of the terminals 
and land depots is underway in 
partnership with an external service 
provider "Foundation Valencia Port". 
This assessment will make it possible 
to define the carbon footprint of the 
facilities and to draw up a detailed 
roadmap for reducing emissions, 
taking into account the geographical, 
energy and economic specificities of 
the various terminals and land depots. 
Even before the results of the review, 
initiatives were taken on terminals/
deposits during the year:
–	 
Investment in electric material han-
dling equipment 
–	 
Conducting studies for the deploy-
ment of photovoltaic panels or wind 
turbines
–	 
The Malta Freeport Terminal has 
implemented one of the largest 
and most diverse photovoltaic pro-
jects on the Maltese islands. With 
more than 25,000 m2 of space wit-
hin the Malta Freeport terminals, 
the project incorporates rooftop 
panels on its buildings, solar par-
king, solar bus shelters and electric 
car charging stations. The deve-
lopment of this terminal - one of 
the largest consumers of electri-
city on the island - demonstrates 
the Group's active commitment 
to reducing its carbon impact. 
This project represents a saving 
of more than 2000 tons of CO2 per 
year.
29% of the terminals controlled by the 
Group have obtained ISO 14001 certi-
fication:  Malta, Casablanca, Montoir, 
Marseille Manutention, Med Europe 
Terminal (Marseille), Dunkirk, Odessa, 
Thessaloniki, Mundra (9/31).
CEVA LOGISTICS' CO2  
FOOTPRINT
In 2019, the first estimate of CO2 emis-
sions was done. It was based on ave-
raged information and estimates from 
its centralised information systems. In 
2020, CEVA Logistics carried out its 
first environmental reporting exercise 
with all of its sites: this enabled us to 
define the energy consumption of our 
warehouses and trucks fleet. This exer-
cise has been renewed and improved 
in 2021, covering a more comprehen-
sive reporting scope. For 2021, scope 
1 and 2 emissions totalled 94 328 for 
the warehouses and 178 849 for the 
truck fleet.
CEVA Logistics' scope 3 emissions are 
mainly related to air, sea and land frei-
ght that the company carries out on 
behalf of its customers. We work with 
our various carriers to measure these 
emissions. CEVA Logistics also plans 
to obtain an evaluation of scope 3 by 
2023, which will serve as a basis for 
specifying the climate goals of all of 
its businesses. CEVA Logistics, as part 
of CMA CGM Group's "Race to Zero" 
commitment and the establishment 
of an SBTI objective, is developing its 
carbon neutrality plan.
DECARBONISATION 
OF LAND TRANSPORT 
BY CEVA LOGISTICS
In 2021, CEVA Logistics continued to 
develop and use alternative energy 
and technology in the land transport 
segment. The company also experi-
mented new multimodal transport 
solutions. In the UK, for example, the 
Doncaster distribution centre has 
been transformed into a sustainable 
logistics hub by using Hydrotreated 
Vegetable Oil (HVO) - a biofuel that 
reduces emissions from its produc-
tion and combustion by up to 90% 
- for its truck fleet. CEVA Logistics 
has also developed a biofuel supply 
chain for CEVA Logistics and Bentley 
Motors vehicles operating around the 
Crewe production site. 
Pilot projects for testing electric 
vehicles are also being carried out. 
In the US, a long-term partnership 
has been signed with Daimler Trucks 
North America and Penske Truck Lea-
sing for eM2 electric vehicles. 
In addition to alternative energies, 
we know that multimodal transport 
will also help reducing the impact 
of freight. The major challenge for 
CEVA Logistics, as a freight forwar-
der, is to integrate changes in modes 
while maintaining the service levels 
and delivery times agreed with cus-
tomers. In 2021, this solution was 
tested in Italy: in the first year, 11,000 
heavy goods vehicles were taken off 
the roads, saving 16, 000 tonnes of 
CO2.
The Benelux countries have also 
tested these solutions and found 
that barge transport has many advan-
tages over road transport: it reduces 
costs and damage, improves relia-
bility, increases flexibility and finally 
reduces CO2 emissions.
Finally, in the UK, CEVA Logistics 
has teamed up with Absolutely and 
Livett's Group to organise a twice-

MATTHIEU FRIEDBERG, 
CEO of CEVA Logistics
As regards other modes of trans-

rect impact on climate change, it is 
working to offer 'green' options to its 
Produce our energy by 
installing photovoltaic 
panels
CEVA Logistics deploys solutions 
to produce its electricity from pho-
tovoltaic panels: 1.3 million square 
metres of photovoltaic panels will 
be installed on its warehouses by 
2025. They will complement the 
500,000 square metres already in 
place. CEVA Logistics leases most of 
its warehouses. In order to increase 
the percentage of renewable energy, 
CEVA Logistics is working with the 
landlords to develop these energies 
(solar panels for example). 
Choosing renewable energy 
suppliers 
CEVA Logistics is promoting the 
deployment of green contracts with 
energy suppliers. For example, CEVA 
Logistics UK & Ireland has recently 
switched to a 100% renewable energy 
contract for all its operations. We aim 
to extend this type of contract to sites 
where it is not possible to install pho-
tovoltaic equipment.
Give preference to certified 
buildings  
Finally, for its new sites, CEVA Logis-
tics is committed to favouring certi-
fied buildings. These certifications 
(BREEAM, Green Star Standards, 
etc.) reflect a better environmental 
performance of the warehouse. By 
focusing on these sites, CEVA Logis-
tics is making a long-term impact and 
encouraging property developers to 
invest more in green buildings. Our 
portfolio includes 17 certified buil-
dings. Certified buildings such as

OFFICES  
AND FACILITIES 
On a day-to-day basis, the Group seeks 
environmentally friendly approaches in 
the workplace. As a result, CMA CGM 
has launched "Green Offices", an inter-
nal campaign, deployed to agencies 
worldwide, to promote good practices 
and raise awareness among employees 
through:  
–	 
Controlling and reducing the num-
ber of emails sent.
–	 
Controlling and reducing paper 
consumption. 
–	 
Reducing electricity consumption 
and switching to a green electricity 
contract where available.
–	 
The implementation of recycling 
bins and a waste separation pro-
cess in each branch.
To support the collection of half-
yearly data by the agency network, 
"good practice" guides are reviewed 
and transmitted annually and actions 
in line with the above objectives 
(awareness campaign, digital clea-
nup, plastic-free day, etc.) are encou-
raged. By 2025, 100% of agencies will 
have integrated this campaign into 
their management strategy and net 
reduction targets will have been pro-
vided. 
customers. These green offerings are 
presented in Chapter 11 "Providing 
our customers with innovative and 
sustainable solutions"
DECARBONISATION 
OF WAREHOUSES
One of the main levers for the decar-
bonisation of CEVA Logistics' activities 
is to reduce the electricity consump-
tion of the 450 warehouses it ope-
rates (leased and owned buildings), to 
favour the purchase of electricity from 
renewable sources, and also to pro-
duce its electricity by installing photo-
voltaic panels or wind turbines.
Reducing energy 
consumption
As lighting has a substantial impact 
on energy consumption, CEVA Logis-
tics is investing to achieve 100% LED 
lighting in its warehouses by 2023. To 
date, approximately 60% of the CEVA 
warehouse area is already equipped 
with LEDs.

Preserving  
air quality
Pollutant emissions (sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx) 
and particulate matter(PM)) from the combustion of heavy fuel 
oils represent a major public health problem, particularly for 
seafarers, terminal workers and the inhabitants of port cities 
who are particularly exposed. After implementing the use of low-
sulphur fuel oil in January 2020, by IMO regulations, CMA CGM 
is committed to a process of constant reduction of atmospheric 
pollutant emissions through new technologies and the evolution  
of its energy mix.
MAIN  
TECHNICAL 
SOLUTIONS  
USED 
–	 
Conventional fuel oils  with a 
maximum sulphur content of 0,5%
–	 
LNG or biomethane ships
–	 
Scrubber systems:  The Group has 
opted for hybrid scrubbers that can 
be used in a closed-loop, allowing 
sulphur residues to be collected for 
treatment in land-based facilities. 
They equip 12%of the fleet.
Liquefied natural gas (LNG), 
the best solution available 
today
LNG is currently the industry's leading 
solution for maintaining air quality. It 
reduces SOx emissions by 99%, PM 
by 91% and NOx by 92%, well below 
the thresholds associated with current 
regulations.
END OF  
EMISSIONS IN PORTS 
THANKS TO SHORE 
POWER
By connecting to shore power (also 
known as "cold ironing" or "shore 
power"), container ships calling at 
ports can switch off their auxiliary 
engines and still get the power 
they need, for example, to maintain 
the temperature of reefer contai-
ners. CMA CGM vessels currently 
connect at berth in California, in 
accordance with local regulations, 
and voluntarily in various ports that 
offer this type of service, mainly in 
China and Europe.
In the Flanders terminal, the shore 
power system was installed in 2020 
and is one of the most powerful 
systems in Europe. As a result, the 
Group now has an integrated facility 
in the port of Dunkirk.
All new vessels built are pre-equip-
ped with shore power so that they 
are ready when ports are equip-
ped. CMA CGM Group has imple-
mented a major renovation plan for 
its existing vessels. Between 2015 
and 2020, 52 ships were modified 
with a shore power system. In 2021, 
 
10 ships were subject to modifi-
cations, and the 2022 schedule 
includes 16 ships. 
The Group is also investing in elec-
tric handling equipment at the ter-
minals to improve air quality and to 
take into account, local residents.

Protecting marine  
and inland biodiversity
Sustainable use of the oceans and respect for marine life are 
core principles of CMA CGM Group. The Group's actions and 
commitments go beyond reducing its impact at sea and on ashore 
by supporting research and recovery initiatives in favour of 
biodiversity conservation
MEASURING AND 
REDUCING OUR 
IMPACT
Ocean repository 
In 2021, CMA CGM carried out a precise 
assessment of its impacts on marine bio-
diversity thanks to the Ocean reference 
supported by the Fondation de la Mer, 
the French Ministry of Ecological Tran-
sition. This tool is designed with and for 
companies based on Sustainable Deve-
lopment Goal 14. Following this assess-
ment, CMA CGM Group has imple-
mented concrete actions and defined 
indicators to measure its improvements.
Green marine europe label  
At the International Union for Conser-
vation of Nature Summit held in 
Marseille in September 2021, the 
French President welcomed the 
Group's commitment to join the 
Green Marine Europe label in order 
to further improve its environmental 
performance. This is a multi-crite-
ria environmental certification pro-
gramme for the European maritime 
industry created in 2019 at the initia-
tive of Surfrider Foundation Europe. 
CMA CGM's commitment to this 
certification process is in line with 
our membership of the Sails Charter 
(Sustainable Actions for Innovative 
and Low-impact Shipping) initiated 
by the French Ministry of Ecological 
Transition and “Armateurs de France”.
Prevention of accidental 
releases
To prevent accidental discharge at sea, 
and in particular oil pollution related to 
the Group's ships, a range of measures 
have been taken, such as ﬂeet mainte-
nance, regular exercises and simula-
tions and a robust crisis management 
plan. In addition, 60  vessels of the ﬂeet 
are equipped with the FORS (Fast Oil 
Recovery System), which enables the 
oil recovery from bunkers with a system 
of standardised fittings in the event of a 
grounding or collision.
Loss of container
Containers can be lost at sea every year 
due to difficult sailing conditions or some-
times due to incidents. To reduce this risk, 
the Group strictly monitors its risks and 
optimises navigation through navigation 
and weather routing centres, which are 
constantly on the lookout. Finally, a contai-
ner security system has been deployed 
onboard its fleet to avoid incident.  In 2021, 
no containers were lost at sea.
Ballast water treatment

ECOSYSTEMS
Marine fauna and flora
On the east coast of the United States 
and Canada, CMA CGM vessels reduce 
their speed to 10 knots when naviga-
ting in cetacean and marine mammal 
breeding areas, to reduce the risk of 
collision. 
CMA CGM is partnering with the Che-
sapeake Bay Foundation to help raise 
5.5 million juvenile oysters to preserve 
the region's water quality and biodiver-
sity. The partnership allows CMA CGM 
to join the Chesapeake Oyster Alliance, 
a coalition of 75 partner organizations 
based in Maryland and Virginia, whose 
goal is to grow 10 billion new oysters 
by 2025. For this partnership, more than 
50 CMA CGM America employees went 
to work with the Alliance to build the 
future reef cages for nearly one million 
oysters or more than 180,000 m3 of fil-
tered water per day.
In December 2020, CMA CGM Group 
launched the Reef Recovery coral reef 
rehabilitation programme with a first 
project focusing on the Great Barrier 
Reef in partnership with the Australian 
NGO Reef Restoration Foundation.
In 2021, actions were taken in the Phi-
lippines with the Endangered Spe-
cies International (ESI) programme 
to protect and restore approximately 
6,000 km2 in the Coral Triangle.The 
sponsorship established in 2021 with 
the WWF provides in 2022 and 2023 
a project implementation to improve 
the protection of the Tubbataha reefs 
located in the natural park in the heart 
of the Sulu Sea in the Philippines. 
Actions have also been extended to the 
Seychelles in partnership with Nature 
Seychelles, by participating in one of 
the world's largest coral restoration 
programmes through the establish-
ment of nurseries.
Marine Pollution Prevention
CMA CGM financed the installation of 
a waste collection system in a canal in 
Lomé (Togo) before discharge into the 
sea, an initiative led by Entrepreneurs 
du Monde and EIFFAGE. With the 
implementation of this mechanised 
collection system with a lifting capacity 
of 500 kg, no waste will be discharged 
into the sea and it will raise awareness 
among local populations of the impact 
of land-based pollution.
FOREST ECOSYSTEM 
RESTORATION  
Planting for Planet
Following the announcement made by 
CMA CGM's CEO, Rodolphe Saadé, in 
December 2020, the Group has started 
its reforestation programme, conduc-
ted with its trusted partner PUR PRO-
JET, by planting one tree per employee. 
Based on pre-established local refores-
tation programmes, this inspiring ope-
ration aims not only to support local 
communities and their environment but 
also to create value for local farmers, 
producers and exporters.
Within the framework of the program, 
55 employees (from Romania, China, 
Canada and Indonesia) have had the 
chance to go to the field and partici-
pate in the planting of trees. 
Further actions are planned for 2022 
in France, Brazil, China, New Zealand 
and the USA. An extension of the pro-
gramme is also planned for 2022, in 
Guadeloupe, Martinique, Lebanon and 
Madagascar.
CEVA Logistics has also launched 
several reforestation programmes in 
Brazil, the Philippines, Romania and 
Colombia. In Brazil, CEVA Logistics 
has partnered with the SOS Mata Atlâ-
ntica Foundation in a carbon credit 
programme for the protection and res-
toration of the Atlantic Forest. CEVA 
Logistics LATAM region acquired 
2,028 seedlings from the Foundation 
for allocation to the Florestas do Futuro 
(Forests of the Future) forest restoration 
programme.
Forest ecosystems
The Group is mobilising to respond 
to the environmental emergency fol-
lowing the recent fires in the Var region 
and has announced a €1 million dona-
tion for the restoration of natural areas 
in the disaster zone of the Maures plain. 
This donation will be allocated via the 
RESPIR fund which, on the initiative 
of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur 
Region, brings together forest owners 
and public and private financiers in the 
context of the preservation of regional 
forest areas. This donation will make 
it possible to contribute to the entire 
restoration project, in particular, the 
carrying out of a diagnosis to evaluate 
the damage, work to make the ground 
safe in order to secure the routes for the 
fauna and reforestation work which will 
be spread over several years.
PREVENTING THE 
ILLICIT TRAFFICKING 
OF PROTECTED 
SPECIES   
Since 2020, CMA CGM Group has 
tightened up its procedures for ship-
ping protected species, whose trade is 
regulated by the Convention on Inter-
national Trade in Endangered Species 
of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Whe-
never any animal or plant goods are 
carried, shippers must explicitly declare 
whether the species is covered by the 
CITES Convention and, if so, provide 
the required export permit.
Aware of this major challenge, CMA 
CGM Group has made a commitment 
in 2021 alongside WWF France to 
strengthen measures to fight the illegal 
trade in endangered wildlife species. 
This action will be carried out through: 
–	 
The development of appropriate 
tools and procedures for risk mana-
gement.
–	 
Identification of a pilot project in 
relation to technological solutions 
available to prevent illegal trafficking 
of protected species. 
The partnership also aims, through 
the Group's commitment and expe-
rience, to raise awareness of this 
issue and existing solutions among 
the various stakeholders and, more 
generally, the various players in its 
sector of activity.

respecting the integrity of people and the planet. By including a 
circular economy model in its strategy and thinking, CMA CGM 
Group is committed to sustainable transport while reducing 
resource wastage and waste.
PLASTIC AS  
A CIRCULAR 
RESOURCE
Plastic waste reduction 
programme with cma cgm & 
plastic flamingo (PLAF)
In September 2021, CMA CGM helped 
prevent 120 tonnes of plastic waste from 
being dumped in the oceans alongside 
the Plastic Flamingo association. It is a 
Manila-based social enterprise that aims 
to combat marine plastic pollution: it col-
lects and recycles plastic waste before 
it reaches the oceans, raises awareness 
of the harms of marine plastic pollution 
and contributes to recycling initiatives in 
the Philippines. In addition to the envi-
ronmental impact of this partnership, 
this project will create full-time jobs and 
modernise the plastic sorting and recy-
cling line for the manufacture of floors 
and roofs for emergency shelters.
Single-use plastic a bord
A working group was launched in 2021 
to rethink our consumption patterns 
on board and eliminate the use of 
single-use plastics, reduce our plastic 
consumption and/or have a higher qua-
lity of plastic. 
Plastic Odyssey
Plastic Odyssey is a 3-year expedition 
with 30 stops. The aim is to demons-
trate the potential for recycling plas-
tic through an equipped ship during 
the various ports of call. On 200m2, a 
dozen technologies will be installed 
on board to show how to collect, sort, 
crush, melt, pyrolyse plastic and be 
able to reuse it (fuel or other recycled 
objects). The ship will also serve as a 
laboratory for technological innova-
tions developed by start-ups: weather 
routing, water purification, augmented 
reality on the bridge, cogeneration, 
etc.
MANAGEMENT  
OF WASTE AND  
OUR PHYSICAL 
ASSETS
Green ship programme 
Since 2008, the Group has been com-
mitted to a green and exemplary 
approach to exceed the requirements 
of the MARPOL maritime regulations: 
the "Green Ship" programme. All 
Group-owned vessels participate in 
this programme. For example, the 
quantities of waste produced are 
monitored, updated and reported, 
specific training sessions are conduc-
ted onboard and ashore, and sorting 
and recycling solutions are proposed 
whenever possible.
Responsible solutions  
for ship dismantling
CMA CGM Group uses dismantling 
shipyard that meet and exceed the 
health, safety and environmental stan-
dards of the Hong Kong Convention. 
CMA CGM audits these sites directly 
and uses third party organisations to 
monitor procedures on a daily basis 
during the dismantling process. In 2021 
no vessels were sent for dismantling.

Reuse of cma cgm containers
Many containers have been reused and 
converted into emergency shelters to 
support local communities following 
natural disasters, but also into cultu-
ral projects such as the "Bibliotobiss". 
This container, donated by CMA CGM 
Group, has been transformed into a 
mobile library and was inaugurated in 
June 2021 in Casablanca.
REDUCING WASTE  
IN LOGISTICS
CEVA Logistics' Contract Logistics 
(CL) team has launched the CL Green 
Project: this project aims to operate 
warehouses in a sustainable way and 
create long-term value for customers, 
employees, investors, communities and 
other stakeholders while minimising 
waste and costs. A network of "Green 
Champions" is deployed throughout 
the Group: these ambassadors regu-
larly share their experience on inno-
vative pilots and solutions, making the 
contract logistics offers even more 
efficient. As an example, here are some 
emblematic achievements:   
–	 
CEVA Logistics LATAM (Latin Ame-
rica) has invested in a cardboard 
shredder that allows it to use 
damaged boxes as cushioning mate-
rial in its e-commerce operations. A 
practice that reduces the use of refill 
packaging by 25%.
–	 
Together with -ARCO and Pack-
size at the Heerlen site in the 
Netherlands, a tailor-made pac-
kaging system has been imple-
mented. With this “content-fit” 
packaging, the use of cardboard 
and the volume of the packages 
are reduced, thus increasing the 
fill rate of the trucks. Optimised 
in terms of filling, the number of 
trucks (and therefore the fuel consu-
med) is reduced. This innovation is 
also important for employees as it 
reduces labour-intensive activities.

Acting ethically and with 
integrity
A CORPORATE 
CULTURE BASED 
ON EXAMPLE AND 
RESPECT FOR THE 
RULES
The Group’s Code of Ethics serves as a 
guide for all staff members, alongside 
other documents, including the Anti-
corruption code, Gifts and hospitality 
policy, Conflict of interest policy and 
Lobbying policy. 
A team of dedicated and specialized 
experts steer and coordinate the Group's 
ethics and compliance program in the 
areas of business ethics and integrity, 
economic sanctions, competition law 
and personal data protection, as well as 
the due diligence program.
The Group’s Code of Ethics : here.
New mandatory 
 training campaigns
As a company, an employer and a cor-
porate citizen, CMA CGM must set an 
example and ensure that the highest 
standards are met.
In 2021, the Group launched its new 
mandatory training campaign for all 
employees. These training courses cove-
red different themes: 
–	 Harassment prevention.
–	 
Prevention of discrimination and 
action in favour of diversity.
–	 Respect for competition.
–	 Fraud awareness.
–	 
The fundamentals of data protec-
tion.
–	 The fight against corruption.
–	 
Economic sanctions regimes.
–	 
The fight against phishing emails.
ETHICS HOTLINE:  
A SECURE 
SYSTEM FOR 
WHISTLEBLOWERS
The Ethics Hotline by CMA CGM 
introduced in 2019 is available by all 
Group employees and third parties 
(suppliers, subcontractors, etc.). 
It operates 24/7 and is available in 
several languages.
This feature is available at the following 
link.
Ethics Hotline allows the whistleblower, 
if he/she so wishes and in compliance 
with the applicable local regulations, to 
remain anonymous. In addition, as part 
of its non-retaliation policy, CMA CGM 
Group is committed to protecting from 
all forms of retaliation individuals who, in 
good faith, report a potential violation of 
the law or internal policies. Employees 
who make such reports in good faith, 
whether through their management, 
CMA CGM Ethics Hotline or other 
means, will not suffer any professional or 
other repercussions.
In 2021, 244 alerts were processed and 
closed out of 321 received:
–	 
36% of alerts concerning CMA CGM.
–	 
64% of alerts concerning CEVA 
Logistics.
In 2021, a significant increase in the 
number of alerts was recorded, 
thanks to an awareness policy among 
employees regarding the ethics alert 
line.
The proportion of closure of alerts 
is lower in percentage terms than in 
2020, as there are more investigations 
and some alerts are still being pro-
cessed. In 2021, no significant violation 
Our goal is to be a responsible business actor to maintain  highest 
standards of business ethics, personal integrity and  compliance  
in all its business activities.

COMPETITIVE  
ENVIRONMENT OR 
ANTITRUST LAWS
For CMA CGM, knowledge of and 
compliance with competition law by its 
employees is an absolute priority. For 
many years, it has had a robust competi-
tion compliance programme applicable 
to all the Group's activities worldwide. In 
2021, its deployment was reinforced for 
the Group's logistics activities.
A team of dedicated and specialised 
lawyers is in charge of implementing 
this program with the support of its local 
referents.
Training is provided worldwide, both 
online and face-to-face. In 2021, 
89.5% of employees have completed 
 
the mandatory "Competition Law" trai-
ning. 
This team also advises all employees to 
ensure that all business practices are car-
ried out in compliance with competition 
law, whether it be one-off issues or com-
plex project management.
All of these efforts are reflected in 
concrete achievements that ensure that 
the Group's activities not only grow but 
also contribute to the promotion of a 
healthy and fair economic environment 
for all. Thus in 2021:
- The US, European and Chinese com-
petition authorities have recognised 
that the observed increase in ocean 
freight rates is simply a matter of mar-
ket logic and that the world's major 
shipowners, including CMA CGM, have 
preserved free competition and do 
not agree to determine the prices they 
charge individually.
- The antitrust exemption for mari-
time operating agreements has been 
renewed in Singapore, as these agree-
ments bring benefits to customers (such 
as a better level of service or a reduction 
in the environmental cost of transport).
Finally, the Group implements specific 
measures in the context of its external 
growth operations which are systemati-
cally analysed. In 2021, approximately 50 
transactions were reviewed and, where 
appropriate, notified to the competition 
authorities in about 10 jurisdictions.
COMPLIANCE 
WITH ECONOMIC 
SANCTIONS
As a French company and international 
leader in maritime transport and logis-
tics, CMA CGM Group conducts its 
business in compliance with all appli-
cable Economic Sanctions laws and 
regulations. 
CMA CGM Group is committed to a glo-
bal security and compliance approach, 
which is based on an internal compliance 
program designed to ensure that all 
employees comply with applicable regu-
lations, as well as on the appropriate level 
of cooperation with national and foreign 
authorities on the subject.
The program is based on five pillars: 
–	 
Employee training (more than 89% of 
employees have successfully comple-
ted the e-learning dedicated to com-
pliance with economic sanctions in 
2021 and numerous specific training 
courses for the most exposed staff have 
been provided).
ACTING FOR FAIR TRADE 
10 - Acting ethically and with integrity
–	 
Adequate controls: screening of the 
goods transported by the Group, 
of the entities with which the Group 
interacts, of the containers used for 
countries under US sanctions, of 
the itinerary of our ships, and the 
appropriate payment procedures. 
The Group has also implemented 
controls in its IT systems that auto-
matically block the most critical tran-
sactions, and detect the sensitive 
ones for review. This review is based 
on three lines of defence, involving 
firstly operational staff, then staff 
dedicated to the issue of econo-
mic sanctions, and finally a team 
of experts based at headquarters.
Since 2020, the Group has strengthe-
ned its control organisation by creating 
a "General Inspection" department 
whose first mission was to evaluate 
the economic sanctions compliance 
programme and define an 18-month 
roadmap. Also, in line with the stren-
gthening of the control functions, Risk, 
Compliance, Internal Audit and Gene-
ral Inspection have been grouped in 
the same department since May 2021. 
The consolidation of these functions 
enhances our risk-based approach and 
aims to make CMA CGM a benchmark 
in its field for compliance. In addition, 
the economic sanctions compliance 
team contributes to CMA CGM's audit 
plan to ensure that these risks are 
reviewed regularly.
PROTECTION  
OF PERSONAL  
DATA
Data is a strategic asset, therefore CMA 
CGM launched a global Data Gover-
nance initiative to create trust in data, to 
break organisational siloes and to secure 
success of key use cases delivery. 
This program is based on 3 main pillars:  
	
· Foundation to integrate & oversee 
Group Data Strategy through a strong 
framework​
 
	
· Implementation to act as a global 
data guarantor by supporting Data 
Governance & Management initiatives  
Adoption to lead Business Data Transfor-
mation thanks to a strong data culture, 
by promoting usage that will bring value 
through new services.   
CMA CGM Group has also been com-
mitted for several years to a policy 
of personal data protection within 
its information systems and with its 
subcontractors. 
To apply its policy on personal data pro-
tection, the Group has set up:
–	 
A network of Data Protection Offi-
cers (DPOs);
–	 
An employee training plan,
–	 
An audit plan.
The DPO appointed by the Group 
ensures that the personal data protec-
tion policy is properly applied.
PREVENTION OF 
ILLICIT TRAFFICKING  
The prevention of all illicit trafficking, 
whether in drugs and weapons, protec-
ted species or counterfeit goods, is a 
constant concern for the Group. In 2021, 
the Group continued to strengthen its 
capacity to prevent such traffic, both 
onboard containers and through the 
various vectors involved in the Group's 
logistics activities. 
New tools and procedures are 
constantly being developed, and there 
is full cooperation with the competent 
authorities, both nationally and interna-
tionally.
For example, the Group is involved in 
the UNODC-WCO Container Control 
Program, a joint UN and WCO program 
targeting the transport of illicit products 
by sea and air containers.

IMPLEMENTATION  
OF A TRANSPARENT 
TAX POLICY
In terms of tax policy, CMA CGM Group 
advocates compliance with the various 
tax laws and the payment of taxes due 
in every country or territory where the 
Group operates, in accordance with 
the rules of law and international tax 
conventions.
In its relations with tax authorities, CMA 
CGM Group is committed to respecting 
procedures in order to build a long-las-
ting and professional relationship 
with the tax authorities of the various 
countries. Due to the complexity of 
tax rules, CMA CGM Group may face 
differences in interpretation with local 
tax authorities. It then reserves the right 
to contest any adjustments that it consi-
ders unfounded.
The Group applies the OECD transfer 
pricing standards and those of national 
laws derived from them.
Tax risk management is an integral part 
of the overall risk management process 
within the Group. The Group adopts a 
responsible approach to tax manage-
ment and control, based on documen-
tation and internal control reports of tax 
processes.
The Group does not encourage or pro-
mote tax evasion, either for itself or for 
its subsidiaries. The Group companies 
located in non-cooperative states and 
territories are established there solely 
for commercial or operational reasons.
Adaptation to the geopolitical context.
Need to comply with numerous economic 
regulations, mainly European, US and 
United Nation.

THE CLIENT’S VOICE	
To better listen to its customers, CMA 
CGM Group launched a global survey 
in 2021 based on more than 250,000 
questionnaires sent out.  
Its objective: to establish the Net 
 
Promoter Score, the reference indica-
tor for evaluating customer satisfac-
tion, and to point out the main areas 
for improvement. This operation will 
continue in 2022 twice a year.
At the same time, the TouchPoint 
survey, initiated in 2019, carried on 
ACTING FOR FAIR TRADE 
OBJECTIVE
• 
At least 40% of the companies financed by the Group have a mission that is compatible with CMA CGM's 
CSR challenges and objectives
• 
To transport at least 75% of goods by rail or barge by 2025
• 
To offer products with low environmental impact
• 
To propose carbon offset projects
• Maintain at least one third of foreign companies financed by the Group
into 2021. The survey is based on two 
questions sent to every person who 
has been involved in customer service. 
This year, 245,000 questionnaires were 
sent out and 11,000 responses were 
received. This survey will continue in 
2022, for the third year.
Lastly, in 2021, the Group-wide roll-
out of specific training to improve the 
customer experience continued. Intro-
duced in 2019, the training is intended 
for employees who are in direct or 
indirect contact with clients. It helps 
to streamline interactions and take into 
account the entire customer journey. 
This year it took place in 25 countries 
and the 4 shared service centres.
In the complex and challenging opera-
ting environment of 2021, CMA CGM 
put in place appropriate measures to 
provide clients with better visibility 
on the factors affecting their supply 
chain. Regular reports on operational 
issues and regional developments 
were made available to them, enabling 
them to anticipate and manage their 
respective activities in the best pos-
sible way.
2021 witnessed an increase in tariffs 
due to port congestion and the imba-
lance between demand and effective 
shipping capacity. The Group decided 
to stop any further increase in freight 
rates on all services operated by its 
brands (CMA CGM, CNC, Contai-
nerships, Mercosul, ANL, APL) from 
September 2021 to February 2022. 
This strong commitment marks the 
Group's desire to build a relationship 
of trust with its customers.
« At CMA CGM Group, we support our client’s long-
term needs with tailor-made transport and logistics 
solutions that help them adopt more sustainable 
practices while innovating and imagining with them

CMA CGM Group received the highest 
level of recognition with an "A" score 
and a rating of 435/463. 
INNOVATION  
AT THE SERVICE OF 
OUR CUSTOMERS
An innovative service offer 
with cma cgm+
CMA CGM+ offer includes more than 
45 value-added products and services 
that complement the shipping and 
logistics services.
It is divided into five categories:
–	 
the "Protection of goods" pro-
gramme guarantees, protects and 
secures the goods transported, even 
the most fragile or sensitive ones.
–	 
"Serenity" simplifies claims mana-
gement in the event of damage to 
goods or containers.
–	 
"Supply Chain Optimisation" pro-
vides the agility needed to manage 
right combination of ports and modes 
for a door-to-door route.
In addition, CEVA Logistics UK won 
in 2021 the Supply Chain Excellence 
Award for the quality of its waterway 
delivery service on the Thames.
ACT WITH CMA  
CGM+: HEADING 
TOWARDS NET ZERO 
CARBON
At the end of 2020, CMA CGM Group 
launched Act With CMA CGM+, a 
range of solutions enabling the Group's 
client’s to reduce and/or offset their 
greenhouse gas emissions from ship-
ping. These solutions are based on the 
use of biofuels (biomethane, biofuel). 
The associated CO2 reductions are 
allocated according to a mass balance 
concept. To complement this offer, the 
Group offers a residual emission com-
pensation service.
These solutions were very successful in 
2021, with approximately 780 000 TEUs 
transported with Act With CMA CGM+. 
141 KT of CO2 were reduced and 602 KT 
of CO2 were offset. 494 179 trees were 
planted (in addition to the tons offset).
The Act With CMA CGM+ solutions will 
continue to be successful in 2022, with 
significant growth prospects. The intro-
duction of an additional range of inno-
vative products is under consideration, 
such as the possibility of recycling the 
packaging used in the containers. It will 
strengthen the Group's offer.
the supply chain.

"Environmental Services" analyses,

footprint of customers.

"Business Support" assists clients in 
growing their business.  
 
Supporting innovation 
In 2021, Rodolphe Saadé, CEO of CMA 
CGM Group, has reaffirmed his strategy 
to support innovation. The Group sup-
ported 195 innovative companies, more 
than a third of which were foreign com-
panies. 42% of its innovative startups 
have a mission that corresponds to the 
CSR challenges of CMA CGM Group.
One of the French nuggets supported 
is Sea routes. Created in 2019, the 
startup helps shippers to go beyond 
the mere calculation of the carbon 
footprint, by identifying the levers to 
reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions.  For example, a shipper 
can reduce GHG emissions by 30% 
by favouring newer, larger and slower 
vessels, and up to 60% by choosing the

 OBJECTIVE
A commercial success for products  
to reduce and offset our customers' 
carbon footprint 
Customers opting for Act With CMA 
CGM+ receive a statement, for the 
reduction of GHG emissions, or a cer-
tificate, for their offset. These docu-
ments are subject to verification by a 
third party confirming that the Group 
is indeed acting in accordance with the 
product standard.
This concept has also been deployed at 
CEVA Logistics under the name "Green 
Ocean offer". This "responsible" ship-
ping offer allows customers to com-
pensate their CO2 emissions or to use 
alternative energies such as bio-LNG 
or biofuel, which can reduce CO2 emis-
sions by 25% and 80% respectively. In 
addition, CEVA Logistics has decided 
to offer carbon offsetting to all its Grou-
page customers in partnership with 
PUR Projet and is thus financing forest 
protection projects in Latin America for 
the equivalent of 25,000 tons of CO2.
Our clients choose different ways of 
communicating on this theme. For exa-
mple, La Banane de Guadeloupe & Mar-
tinique will promote its environmental 
actions thanks to a QR code placed on 
the Fair Trade French Banana ribbons. In 
particular, the company will point out its 
use of bio-fuel, with the support of CMA 
CGM, for the transport of bananas.

DIGITAL SOLUTIONS 
FOR CARBON 
FOOTPRINT 
OPTIMISATION AND 
MEASUREMENT
Tailor-made solutions are being stu-
died to optimise maritime transport. 
Several new intermodal options are 
also being considered for door-to-
door transport. For the sixth consecu-
tive year, the Group offers its clients a 
personalised report analysing the car-
bon footprint of their shipments. Since 
2020, the service was included in the 
package for "Elite" clients. "Elite" is 
the highest rank given to the Group's 
clients based on various criteria. On 
the online Eco Monitor platform, which 
will be launched in 2022, client’s will be 
able to find out their greenhouse gas 
emissions from the transport of their 
goods. They will be able to purchase 
services and see the direct impact on 
their summary. In 2022, CMA CGM will 
introduce a door-to-door eco-calcula-
tor, developed with SeaRoutes, which 
will enable customers to obtain an 
estimate of the carbon footprint for 
each mode of transport used and thus 
choose the least polluting multimodal 
solutions. 
In 2021, CEVA Logistics also deve-
loped various digital solutions for the 
calculation of CO2 emissions. Each 
client can now benefit from on-de-
mand carbon reports for all their air 
SOLUTIONS TO MEET 
OUR CUSTOMERS' 
NEEDS
If requested by clients, it is possible to 
include CO2 data for each ports pair 
offered. Information on CO2 emissions 
is also available throughout the client 
experience:
–	 
Pre-shipment: an open-access 
eco-calculator is available on the 
E-Business website and the CO2 car-
bon footprint is also provided in the 
MY Price online route search and quo-
tation tool.
–	 
After shipment: CO2 emissions are 
displayed in the client dashboard for 
connected clients. A geographical 
analysis by major route and mode 
of transport is available in the cus-
tomised CO2 report, available on 
request.
Fewer trucks on the road, a smaller car-
bon footprint, fast deliveries and com-
petitive pricing solutions are all encou-
raged by CMA CGM Group which, in 
general, favours bulk transport solu-
tions. Furthermore, in 2021, 71 % of 
the Group's overland freight transport 
was based on rail or barge solutions. 
Despite a shortage of these services 
and infrastructure in some parts of the 
world, CMA CGM's goal is to increase 
this share to 75% by 2025.
A KEY LOGISTICS 
PARTNER FOR 
HUMANITARIAN 
ORGANISATIONS
CMA CGM Group established a Huma-
nitarian Services Office at the end of 
2017, which offers customised solutions 
to international organisations and NGOs 
providing emergency aid. In 2021, the 
Group managed the transport of almost 
26 692 TEU of emergency aid.
EXPERTISE IN 
EMERGENCY 
SITUATIONS
Since the beginning of the health crisis 
which affected the whole world, CMA 
CGM Group has been conducting 
solidarity actions to fight the Covid-19 
pandemic. Thanks to its experience in 
humanitarian operations in Lebanon, 
France and around the world, CMA 
CGM Group can participate in unpre-
cedented operations and offer rapid 
solutions adapted to the situation.
CEVA Logistics has created a new 
sub-brand FORPATIENT dedicated to 
pharmaceutical and healthcare compa-
nies. The goal is to create a responsive 
and reliable supply chain to benefit 
patients. In 2021, CEVA Logistics trans-
ported 700,000 doses of the Sinovac 
Covid-19 vaccine, at a temperature 
between 2 and 8°C to respect the cold 
chain.
To respond to the health crisis caused 
by the new Covid-19 wave that affected 
Guadeloupe and Martinique, CMA CGM 
Group planned and organised the ope-
ration within a few days. Local hospitals 
needed medical equipment including 
oxygen generators, concentrators and 
cylinders, but also X-ray equipment 
and dialysis equipment. To meet these 
needs, CMA CGM Group mobilised 
an Airbus A330-200F from its fleet to 
transport the 43 tonnes of equipment 
between Paris and the West Indies.

and sea shipments. In 2022, a tool will 
be developed to provide clients with 
self-service access to these reports. 
Specific work will also be undertaken 
on land expeditions, an important 
challenge due to its organisational 
specificities.
In 2021, CEVA Logistics launched its 
eco-calculator. Built internally and 
based on its partner Searoutes, this 
public tool provides, for a given jour-
ney and mode of transport, an esti-
mate of the associated CO2 emissions. 
It is currently available for four modes: 
air, sea, road and rail. In 2022, this tool 
will be improved and extended to river 
transport.

Ensuring a sustainable  
supply chain
Creating and ensuring a sustainable supply chain and being 
supported by suppliers and subcontractors in a sustainable way is a 
key issue to reduce risks for individuals, society, the economy and 
the environment, and to better face and manage the challenges of 
tomorrow.
THE PARTNER 
CHARTER
The Third-Party Code of Conduct defines 
the standards required from CMA CGM's 
partners, including its suppliers, their 
employees and their subcontractors.  The 
principles set out in this document apply 
to all contractual relationships between 
CMA CGM and its partners. These are 
very demanding principles, based on a 
strict normative framework. A plan to inte-
grate the Charter is currently underway 
at CEVA Logistics. Its implementation 
will start in 2022. Signing the  Third-Party 
Code of Conduct is a prerequisite for 
any commitment with our suppliers or 
subcontractors.
The Third-Party Code of Conduct is 
available here.
In 2022, CMA CGM Group will focus its 
efforts on monitoring suppliers iden-
tified as "high risk" and launching an 
on-site audit programme.
CMA CGM Group is launching a vast 
supplier data optimisation programme 
to reinforce and accelerate its res-
ponsible purchasing approach.  
Furthermore, the group has set up a 
specific governance structure brin-
ging together all the departments 
concerned: risk, operational purcha-
sing, CSR, finance, compliance, etc., in 
order to support buyers in their deci-
sion-making. A similar programme is 
being integrated at CEVA Logistics.
A digital portal to facilitate 
the qualification process
CMA CGM Group has developed Score, 
a digital SRM (Supplier Relationships 
Management) portal, to simplify the 
qualification process and improve its 
deployment. An integration plan is 
being developed with CEVA Logistics 
to align the systems. A presentation and 
integration video has been produced by 
the Group to support its suppliers in this 
quality approach.

rement/how-to-become-a-supplier
The way to buy: the 
responsible purchasing 
policy for the Group's buyers
In addition, in order to strengthen the 
monitoring of risks associated with 
suppliers and to share best practices, 
CMA CGM Group has set out the fun-
damentals of its responsible purcha-
sing policy in The Way To Buy. This 
policy is intended for all employees 
involved in purchasing and dealing 
with suppliers. To ensure the unders-
tanding and application of this purcha-
sing policy, an e-learning programme 
was developed in 2021 and sent to the 
entire purchasing community. It will be 
deployed in 2022 within CEVA Logis-
tics. 
Procurement academy, 
Two years ago, CMA CGM Group 
created the Procurement Academy 
programme dedicated to the pur-
chasing community. This programme 
aims to train and support employees 
involved in purchasing. In 2022, CMA 
CGM Group aims to strengthen and 
expand this training programme 
and to provide its entire purchasing 
community with a specific training 
module on sustainable procurement. 
The Group also intends to continue 
to support its suppliers in the res-
ponsible purchasing approach.
THE GROUP 
STRENGTHENS 
ITS RESPONSIBLE 
PURCHASING POLICY
For several years, CMA CGM Group has 
been working on a proactive approach 
to responsible purchasing and is com-
mitted to continuous improvement 
in line with the requirements of the 
responsible purchasing label and our 
various partnerships (United Nations 
Global Compact, EcoVadis, etc.).
This approach aims to increase not only 
the Group's risk control but also the 
positive impact on social and environ-
mental issues.
CMA CGM Group has stepped up its 
efforts to promote sustainable procu-
rement by deploying a global assess-

Methodology
CSR indicators are updated annually. They were 
defined according to the UNGC's 10 principles, the 
17 Sustainable Development Objectives, the Glo-
bal Reporting Initiative (GRI) criteria, in compliance 
with the obligations set out in French law (Law on 
new economic regulations, known as the "NRE Law", 
of May 15, 2001), the European Union directive on 
the publication of non-financial information and, 
to the extent possible, the applicable international 
standards.
We consider the following information to be outside the 
scope of the Group's activities:
- Fight food insecurity
- Fight against food waste
- Protection of animal welfare
- Responsible, fair and sustainable food
Details and methodological limitations of the indica-
tors: 
Some indicators are published on the financial conso-
lidated scope of the Group. Some others are publi-
shed on a limited scope regarding the specificities of 
activites
Scope:  The CMA CGM Group publishes consolidated 
non-financial information on the Group's scope. However, 
scope limitations may be applied on a case-by-case basis for 
certain indicators because of the maturity of the reporting 
and the process. In case of a restriction of the scope, these 
are systematically explained in the DPEF about the titles of 
the indicators concerned. CMA CGM Group is committed 
to extending the reporting scope of the indicators that are 
subject to a significant scope limitation in the coming years
In 2021, the Group integrated the subsidiary Air Cargo, 
however, no aircraft of its own were operated during that 
year. This subsidiary's data will be included in the 2022 finan-
cial year.
Périod : The reporting period will be from January 1, 
2021, to December 31, 2021.
ACTING FOR PEOPLE
Total workforce: 
– 
The workforce covers the consolidated Group scope 
as of December 31 of the reference year. This includes 
permanent contracts, fixed-term contracts, internships 
and international voluntary work experience.
– 
The workforce by age, gender and the geographical 
area represents 90% of the Group's workforce. The 
scope does not include international crew members, as 
the contracts are not Group contracts, and it does not 
include sedentary staff who are not reported in C&Me.
Hirings and exits: 
These indicators cover 90% of the Group's workforce. .
– 
The scope does not include international crew members, 
as the contracts are not Group contracts, and it does not 
include sedentary staff who are not reported in C&Me.
– 
Intra-group" transfers are recorded as movements: this 
means that any person who is transferred, signs a new 
employment contract or an amendment with a Group 
company is considered as a new hire or a new depar-
ture.
Share of women in management:
– 
This indicator cover 90% of the Group's workforce.
– 
This is the number of women in managerial positions, 
i.e. female employees with at least one direct report.
– 
The scope does not include international crew 
members, as their contracts are not Group contracts, 
nor does it include sedentary staff who are not reported 
in C&Me.
Share of women in the top 100 salaries and share of 
non-French nationals in the top 100 earners (in %):
– 
The TOP 100 corresponds to the 50 highest salaries at 
CMA CGM and the 50 highest salaries at CEVA Logis-
tics.
Number of training days per employee:
– 
The ratio is calculated from a limited scope that covers 
30 countries for CMA CGM and 72 countries for CEVA 
Logistics, the scope of coverage for the total workforce 
is 86%. The Group is committed to expanding this 
scope every year.
– 
The headcount considered is the headcount at the end 
of November.
– 
The number of days is calculated based on hours. 
– 
Until 2020, we considered a training day to be 8 hours. 
From the financial year 2021 onwards, we consider a 
training day to be 7 hours. 
– 
In the scope of international seafarers, mandatory trai-
ning that is the responsibility of the seafarers is not 
taken into account.
Share of employees with access to health coverage: 
– 
The indicator for CEVA Logistics was published for the 
first year in 2021.
– 
The CMA CGM seagoing workforce is excluded from 
the reporting scope.
– 
The methodologies for calculation differ between CMA 
CGM and CEVA::
• 
CMA CGM considers that coverage should cover 
three criteria: inpatient, outpatient and pharmacy. 
• 
CEVA considers that inpatient and outpatient are enough 
to evaluate if the country provides health coverage to 
employees.
• 
CMA CGM reports the number of employees to 
whom the Group offers health cover, while CEVA 
reports the number of employees who have accep-
ted health cover.
Maritime safety indicators
The scope of the maritime safety indicators includes 
owned vessels only (and therefore excludes chartered 
vessels).
Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) Maritime:
– 
The total number of hours worked is the total number of 
days on board x 24 hours. As a reminder: lost-time acci-
dents occurring after landing are not counted or conso-
lidated, nor are those occurring on chartered vessels, 
as these are the responsibility of the shipowners.
Terminal safety indicators (frequency rate, severity 
rate, number of fatal accidents, number of level D 
major accidents, number of near accidents and dan-
gerous situations): 
The scope represents all terminals that are subject to the 
CMA CGM Terminals QSSE policy.
Safety indicators for inland activities (frequency rate, 
severity rate, number of fatal accidents, number of 
level D major accidents, number of near accidents and 
dangerous situations)
The scope covers all employees subject to the CMA 
CGM Inland QSSE policy, except for the CMA CGM 
frequency rate, for which the scope of coverage corres-
ponds to 64% of the QSSE workforce.
Percentage of countries that have launched at least 
one local initiative: 
– 
A local initiative is a one-off or recurring voluntary initia-
tive undertaken by a CMA CGM Group entity (CMA CGM, 
ANL, MERCOSUL Line, APL, CNC and Containerships) in 
which employees from one or more CMA CGM Group 
divisions participate. These initiatives, which concern one 
of the strategic pillars of Sustainable Development, can 
have a direct impact on the local populations in which the 
Group and its subsidiaries are involved. These initiatives 
must contribute to the achievement of at least one of the 
17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

ACTING FOR PLANET
Offset CO2 emissions 3 Maritime activities CMA 
CGM: 
– 
Scope 3 emissions come from the construction of 
ships and containers, the production of waste (solid 
and liquid) from ships, business travel by employees, 
the consumption of fuel for land transport and the 
upstream phase of production and transport of the fuel 
consumed.
– 
CO2 emission (scope 3) are not reported by some sub-
sidiaries of the Group (CEVA Logistics and Terminal )
– 
Shipbuilding: The impact is calculated from the carbon 
dioxide emissions from the production of the steel nee-
ded to build the ships, measured based on the weight 
of steel in the ships (emission factor of 2.21). We take 
into account the average number of ships produced 
over 5 years. Emissions from construction sites are 
unknown at present but are assumed to be negligible. 
Emissions from chartered vessels are estimated from 
the emissions of owned vessels, pro-rata by twenty-
foot equivalent units (TEU).
– 
Container construction: Emissions from container 
manufacturing are estimated from the number of 
containers refurbished each year and converted to raw 
stainless steel (2.2 tonnes of steel per container). Steel 
emission factor = 2.21.
– 
Upstream fuel and Energy: Upstream carbon dioxide 
emissions are calculated using the following emission 
factors:
HFO
0.26 kg  
CO2 e/kg
Sources : 
EN16258
DO
0.68 kg

– 
Land freight: We apply standard emission factors 
for each mode of transport (rail freight, road freight, 
barges) to calculate the corresponding carbon foot-
print before and after sea freight.
– 
Solid waste the volume of solid waste generated by 
owned vessels. Waste emissions from chartered ves-
sels are estimated from the emissions of owned vessels, 
pro-rata to the twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) km.
– 
Sludge produced by vessels: In the absence of a com-
monly accepted emission factor for sludge, we apply 
the emission factor for carbon dioxide. We apply this 
emission factor to the total amount of sludge produced 
during the reference period.
– 
Business travel: We estimate that a pilot makes 10 
flights per year (round trip) and travels an average of 
10,000 km per flight. We multiply this factor by the 
number of passengers in the reference year and by the 
ADEME emission factor of 0.083 kg CO2e/passenger for 
long-distance travel.
CO2 emissions CEVA Logistics:
– 
 CEVA Logistics reports warehouses & trucks energies 
consumption and associated CO2 emissions scope 1 
and 2  
Maritime fleet fuel consumption: 
– 
The consumption concerns the entire operational fleet 
(owned + chartered vessels). It includes the following 
types of fuel oil: HSFO, LSFO, MGO-DO, LNG.L.
LNG-powered ships in nominal TEU:
– 
Total volume capacity of all owned and long-term char-
tered vessels powered by LNG
Alternative Fuels:
– 
Alternative, low-carbon fuels (LNG, Biofuel are included 
in the Group’s energy mix.
Scope 1 carbon dioxide emissions:
– 
They are obtained directly from the fuel consumption. The 
following emission factors are applied to fuel oil consump-
tion for maritime activity:
– 
1 tonne HSFO = 3,114 tonnes of CO2
– 
1 tonne LSFO = 3,151 tonnes of  CO2
– 
1 tonne MGO/DO = 3,206 tonnes of  CO2
– 
1 tonne LNG = 2,75 tonnes of CO2
Carbon dioxide emissions per loaded TEU and 
TEU-Km (scope 1):
– 
Scope: CMA CGM Group’s operating fleet (owned and 
chartered vessels) in the reporting period 
– 
TEU-km = nominal capacity* distance sailed.
Fuel consumption and CO2 emissions –Truck fleet 
(scope 1):
– 
This indicator covers CEVA Logistics’ fuel consumption 
by owned and leased trucks (excluding personal and 
company cars). The scope covers business in the fol-
lowing countries: Germany, India, Turkey, United King-
dom, United States, Canada, and South Africa (covers 
88% of our truck fleet). Other countries have been 
excluded as they do not operate truck fleets. Lebanon 
is currently out of scope but will be included next year.
– 
Carbon dioxide emissions are calculated based on the 
energy consumption reported and energy-specific 
emission factors.
Energy consumption and CO2 emissions – War-
ehouses (scope 1&2):
– 
This indicator covers CEVA Logistics' warehouses 
worldwide, both owned and leased with the following 
coverage:
• 83% of the global warehouse space in 2020 
• 90% of the global warehouse space in 2021. 
– 
Warehouses are included in the scope when operated 
during a full quarter  
– 
Energy covers electricity, natural gas, domestic fuel, 
district heating and diesel for manual handling equip-
ments or generators. 
– 
Green electricity corresponds to renewable electricity 	
produced and consumed or bought through green 
electricity contracts.
– 
Carbon dioxide emissions are calculated from the 
reported energy consumption and according to 
country and energy-specific emission factors.
– 
The data does not take into account the natural gas 
consumption of the United States. We consider this 
consumption is non-significant due to the small num-
ber of sites using natural gas (10 sites for an estimated 
impact of 1% on the country's CO2 emissions).
– 
For some sites (representing 13% of the warehouse sur-
face), the energy consumption was estimated on the 
basis of a kWh/m2 ratio calculated at other sites in the 
same country
SOx emissions Maritime activity: 
– 
SOx emissions cover the entire operated fleet. They are 
calculated based on fuel oil consumption per type of 
fuel oil and the maximum mandatory limit of sulphur 
content per type of fuel oil. Sulphur emissions from 
scrubbers are not included in the total SOx emissions.
Nox emissions Maritime activity:
–  NOx emissions cover the entire operated fleet. 
– 
 Source: NOx emission factors 2018 (Source: 4th IMO 
Edition - 2020 on Greenhouse Gases)
Greenhouse gas emissions of CEVA Logistics (exclu-
ding CO2): pollution is not substantial for CEVA Logistics

APPENDICES
To the Annual General Meeting,
In our capacity as Statutory Auditor of your company 
(hereinafter the “entity”)  appointed as independent 
third party, and accredited by the COFRAC under num-
ber 3-10491 , we have undertaken a limited assurance 
engagement on the historical financial information 
(actual or extrapolated) of the consolidated non-finan-
cial statement, prepared in accordance with the entity's 
procedures (hereinafter the "Guidelines"), for the year 
ended 31 December 2021 (hereinafter, respectively, 
the "Information" and the "Statement"), included in the 
Group's management report pursuant to the require-
ments of Articles L. 225 102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 
of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).
At the request of the entity, we conducted works 
designed to express a reasonable assurance conclusion 
on the information selected by the entity and identified 
by the sign √.
Reasonable assurance conclusion on a selection of 
non-financial information
Based on the procedures performed, as set out in the 
"Nature and scope of our work" and "Nature and scope 
of additional work on the information selected by the 
entity and identified by the sign √" sections of this report, 
and the evidences collected, the information selected by 
the entity and identified with the symbol √  in the Sta-
tement has been prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the Guidelines.
Preparation of the Statement
The absence of a commonly used generally accepted 
reporting framework or established practices on which 
to draw to evaluate and measure the Information allows 
for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques 
that can affect comparability between entities and over 
time.
Consequently, the Information needs to be read and 
understood using the Guidelines, the main elements of 
which are presented in the Statement (or available on 
request from the entity's registered office).
Inherent limitations in preparing the Information  
The Information may be subject to inherent uncer-
tainty because of incomplete scientific and economic 
knowledge and the quality of external data used. Some 
information is sensitive to methodological choices, 
assumptions and/or estimates used for their preparation 
and presentation in the Statement.
Responsibility of the entity
The Management Board’s is responsible for:
– 
Selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing 
the Information;
– 
Preparing a Statement in accordance with legal and 
regulatory requirements, including a presentation of 
the business model, a description of the main extra-fi-
nancial risks, a presentation of policies applied to miti-
gate these risks and the outcomes of those policies, 
including key performance indicators;
– 
Implementing internal control over information relevant 
to the preparation of the Information that is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
The Statement was prepared by applying the entity's 
Guidelines as mentioned previously. 
Report by one of the 
Statutory Auditors, 
appointed as independent 
third party, on the 
consolidated non-financial 
statement 
For the year ended 31 December 2021
Limited assurance conclusion
Based on the procedures performed, as set out in the 
"Nature and scope of our work" section of this report, 
and the information collected, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the Statement is 
not presented in accordance with the applicable regu-
latory requirements and that the Information, taken as a 
whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Gui-
delines, in all material respects.
Comment
Without modifying our conclusion and in accordance 
with article A. 225-3 of the French Commercial Code, we 
have the following comment:
– 
The Group has strengthened the reporting processes 
and continued to expand the scope of the CSR repor-
ting to all its activities. However, the indicators “CO2 
emissions from warehouse energy consumption” 
and “Scope 3 CO2  emissions” have residual scope or 
methodological limitations, as mentioned in the Guide-
lines described in the Statement. 
Responsibility of the Statutory Auditor, appointed as 
independent third party/independent third party
On the basis of our work, our responsibility is to provide 
a report expressing a limited assurance conclusion on:
– 
The compliance of the Statement with the require-
ments of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial 
Code;
– 
The fairness of the historical financial information 
(actual or extrapolated) provided in accordance with 
Article R.225-105-I(3) and II of the French Commercial 
Code concerning action plans and policy outcomes, 
including the key performance indicators on the main 
risks.
As it is our responsibility to provide an independent 
conclusion on the Information as prepared by Manage-
ment, we are not authorised to help prepare said Infor-
mation, as that could compromise our independence.
At the request of the entity and outside of the scope of 
certification, we may express reasonable assurance that 
the information selected by the entity, presented in the 
appendices, and identified by the symbol √ has been pre-
pared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Gui-
delines.
However, it is not our responsibility to comment on the 
entity's compliance with other applicable legal and regu-
latory requirements, including the duty of care scheme or 
the compliance of products and services with the appli-
cable regulations.
Regulatory provisions and applicable professional 
guidance
We performed our work described below in accordance 
with the provisions of Articles A. 225 1 and following of 
the French Commercial Code, the professional guidance 
issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors 
(Compagnie nationale des commissaires aux comptes) 
relating to this engagement and International Standard 
on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised)2.
Our independence and quality control
Our independence is defined by the provisions of Article 
L. 822-11-3 of the French Commercial Code and the

tory auditors. Our firm maintains a comprehensive sys-
tem of quality control including documented policies 
and procedures regarding compliance with applicable 
legal, regulatory and ethical requirements and the pro-
fessional guidance issued by the French Institute of Sta-
tutory Auditors relating to this engagement.
Means and resources
Our work was carried out by a team of nine people 
between October 2021 and March 2022 and took a total 
of approximately fourteen weeks.
We were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustai-
nable development and corporate social responsibility. 
We conducted some twenty interviews with the people 
responsible for preparing the Statement.
Nature and scope of our work
We planned and performed our work to address the 
areas where we identified that a material misstatement of 
the Information was likely to arise.  
We believe that the work carried out, based on our pro-
fessional judgement, is sufficient to provide a basis for 
our limited assurance conclusion:
– 
We obtained an understanding of all the consolidated 
entities' activities, and the description of the principal 
risks associated; 
– 
We assessed the suitability of the criteria of the Gui-
delines with respect to their relevance, completeness, 
reliability, neutrality and understandability, with due 
consideration of industry best practices, where appro-
priate; 
– 
We verified that the Statement includes each cate-
gory of social and environmental information set out in 
article L. 225-102-1 III;
– 
We verified that the Statement provides the informa-
tion required under article R. 225-105 II of the French 
Commercial Code, where relevant with respect to 
the principal risks, and includes, where applicable, an 
explanation for the absence of the information required 
under article L. 225-102-1 III, paragraph 2 of the French 
Commercial Code;
– 
We verified that the Statement presents the business 
model and a description of principal risks associated 
with all the consolidated entities’ activities, including 
where relevant and proportionate, the risks associated 
with their business relationships, their products or ser-
vices, as well as their policies, measures and the out-
comes thereof, including key performance indicators 
associated to the principal risks;
– 
We referred to documentary sources and conducted 
interviews to:
• 
assess the process used to identify and confirm the 
principal risks as well as the consistency of the outco-
mes, including the key performance indicators used, 
with respect to the principal risks and the policies pre-
sented;
• 
corroborate the qualitative information (measures and 
outcomes) that we considered to be the most impor-
tant presented in Appendix. Concerning certain risk3, 
our work was carried out on the consolidating entity, for 
the other risks, our work was carried out on the consoli-
dating entity and on a selection of entities4.
– 
We verified that the Statement covers the scope of 
consolidation, i.e. all the consolidated entities in accor-
dance with article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial 
Code, within the limitations set out in the Statement;
– 
We obtained an understanding of internal control and 
risk management procedures the entity has put in place 
and assessed the data collection process to ensure the 
completeness and fairness of the Information;
– 
For the key performance indicators and other quantitative 
outcomes that we considered to be the most important, as 
presented in Appendix, we implemented:
• 
analytical procedures to verify the proper consolida-
tion of the data collected and the consistency of any 
changes in those data;
• 
tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order 
to verify the proper application of the definitions and 
procedures and reconcile the data with the supporting 
documents. This work was carried out on a selection 
of contributing entities and covers between 25% and 
100% of the consolidated data selected for these tests;
– 
We assessed the overall consistency of the Statement 
based on our knowledge of all the consolidated enti-
ties.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance enga-
gement are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance 
engagement performed in accordance with the profes-
sional guidance issued by the French Institute of Sta-
tutory Auditors; a higher level of assurance would have 
required us to carry out more extensive procedures.
Nature and extent of additional work on the infor-
mation selected by the entity and identified by the 
sign √
With regard to the information selected by the entity, 
presented in the appendix and identified by the symbol 
√ in the Statement, we conducted the same work as des-
cribed in the paragraph "Nature and scope of our work" 
above for the Information considered to be the most 
important, but in a more in-depth manner, in particular 
with regard to the number of tests.
The selected sample accounts for 100% of the informa-
tion identified by the symbol √.
We believe that our work is sufficient to provide a basis 
for our reasonable assurance opinion on the information 
selected by the entity and identified by the symbol √.
