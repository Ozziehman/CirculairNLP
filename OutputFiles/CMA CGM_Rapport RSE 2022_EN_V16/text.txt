CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
A message  
from the Chairman
"To be useful is our responsibility ; 
 
it is also the key to our sustainability."
In 2022, we had an outstanding year and created meaningful value for the economy, 
 
the environment and society. Nearly 90% of our profits were reinvested in our Group to enable 
us to grow, to ensure we remain resilient, to accelerate our energy transition but also to make 
 
a positive contribution.
On the environmental front, we continued to renew our fleet and modernise our ships. Since 2020, 
over 10 billion dollars have been spent on these efforts and, as a result, by 2027 we will have 
 
a fleet of over 100 ships powered by lower-carbon intensity fuels. To accelerate our move towards 
decarbonising the full range of our activities and to assist the transition of our sector, last year 
 
we created a Fund for Energies with a five-year endowment of 1.5 billion euros. 
A group like ours also has a duty to provide assistance to the most vulnerable populations. 
 
Last year once again, our Foundation was exemplary: it enabled the delivery of nearly 10 million 
meals and the transport of 8,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid to 34 countries around the world, 
and helped tens of thousands of children in need. In addition, several large-scale humanitarian 
operations were organised in conjunction with the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs to assist 
 
the Ukrainian population affected by the ongoing war. 
Finally, we have chosen to show our appreciation to our staff for their outstanding job in 2022 
 
by rewarding them with over 700 million dollars in bonus and pay rise.
The Group has never before shared its value to that extent, for the benefit of all stakeholders.
To be useful is our responsibility ; it is also the key to our sustainability.
In 2023, you can count on CMA CGM Group to continue to reconcile economic, social 
 
and environmental performance.

CMA CGM Group’s CSR strategy is based on a collaborative approach. It is a key aspect of a common 
journey undertaken with all stakeholders, in which everyone has a role to play.
Materiality
In 2021, CMA CGM Group solicited expert assistance in structuring its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
process, taking into account the expectations of its stakeholders. Senior Management and the members 
of the Executive Committee validated and positioned the issues according to their importance in relation 
to the Group’s activities and locations.

Non-financial risks
METHODOLOGY
The Group’s Risk Management team structure, deploy and coordinate the risk mapping and management 
tools. The method for assessing net risks (current residual risks), as well as the 12-months risk level 
projection, is based on a Group assessment grid with two axes:
Analysis of about 
twenty risk factors
7 priority CSR 
risks identifed
including 
two risks 
of the Group's 
major risk map
- the severity of impacts; 
- the probability of occurrence.
For corporate governance purpose, a complete 
presentation of this work is made, at least quarterly, 
at meetings of the following committees:
- the Operational Risk Committee;
- 
the RCAI (Risk, Compliance, Audit & Inspection) 
Committee; and
- 
the Audit and Accounts Committee (a committee 
of the Board of Directors).
The following are the priority CSR risks:
- Failure to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050
- 
Adapting the Group’s activities to biodiversity 
 
and climate change issues
- 
Failure to meet stated environmental objectives, 
including no major pollution and no containers 
lost at sea
- 
Ensuring security, protecting health, improving 
safety and preventing all fatal accidents
- Diversity and inclusion: compliance with local laws 
- Meeting customers’ CSR expectations
- 
Deploying and maintaining an effective dialogue 
with stakeholders
The risks related to ethics and compliance issues 
are also priorities and are closely monitored by the 
Group, as described in Chapter 10 of this document.
In 2022, CMA CGM Group consolidated its CSR 
risk assessment: a detailed map covering the full 
spectrum of the Group’s activities was produced in 
conjunction with all relevant managers, which was 
presented to the RCAI Committee (Risk, Compliance, 
Audit & Inspection) and approved by the Group 
Executive Committee. 
The top-down approach used by the CSR teams, 
with the methodological support of the Group Risk 
Management department, identified and assessed 
 
17 CSR risks. Seven of these risks are considered 
 
to be priorities and are therefore monitored at 
Executive Committee level. Two of these seven 
risks, highlighted in bold below, are included in 
 
the Group’s mapping of major risks.
In addition, this work has highlighted:
- 
a worldwide trend towards regulatory developments 
impacting the full range of CSR issues (environmental, 
social and ethical aspects);
- increasing media and NGO attention to these issues; 
- 
the major challenge that the massive decarbonisation 
of transport and logistics represents for CMA CGM 
Group and its partners.
In accordance with the method deployed by the 
Group, the mapping of the seven priority CSR risks 
is monitored and updated at least twice a year by 
the CSR Department, which is tasked with managing 
this risk exposure. For each risk, one or more "risk 
managers" are chosen from among the Executive 
Committee members to report on the implementation 
of control measures and to monitor the action plans 
established to limit and/or remedy the risk.
A concordance table that cross-references issues 
monitored and CSR risks ensures that all of the Group’s 
CSR issues are adequately covered. We verify that the 
CSR action plans address the major risks identified 
in the strategy pillars and in this document. Control 
plans have been established for all risks identified.

CSR governance
CMA CGM Group’s CSR governance is conducted jointly by 
 
the Group CSR Committee and the Group CSR Department, 
 
and CSR issues are integrated into the strategic thinking of 
 
the Group’s Board of Directors. A network of regional and local 
CSR officers ensures optimal deployment of the Group’s CSR 
strategy within each entity and develops local initiatives in 
 
the 160 countries where the Group does business.
"The development of CMA CGM Group integrates a sustainable 
growth model. We are fully mobilized to transforming our sector 
towards a model that is more environmentally friendly and more 
respectful of people, and we work each day with all our employees 
and partners to achieve this goal. In 2022, we further accelerated 
our commitment to the energy transition, and social and societal 
impact has been a constant guide for our decisions. Our identity  
is reflected in our long-term vision and our day-to-day actions:  
as a family-owned, socially committed, responsible and innovative 
Group. More than goods, we transport values."
TANYA SAADÉ ZEENNY, 
Executive Vice-President and President of the CMA CGM Foundation
The Group CSR Department ensures that the entities 
properly implement the strategy and action plans at 
Group level. It guides and advises management and 
operational staff on the implementation of roadmaps 
for each business line and for each country or region. 
It monitors and measures progress achieved on the 
 
12 priorities. It reports on the Group’s CSR performance 
to the CSR Committee and ensures compliance with 
regulatory requirements and developments. Within 
CEVA Logistics, a dedicated CSR team addresses 
 
the specific challenges of the subsidiary, in accordance 
with the Group’s CSR strategy.
Regional CSR officers translate CSR policies into 
pragmatic action plans and make CSR operational 
within the Group’s culture. They also work with local 
stakeholders and identify key local opportunities. 
They demonstrate and promote the Group’s CSR 
commitment. To carry out these various tasks, they 
receive the support of CSR delegates in each country.
These regional CSR officers report monthly to the 
Group CSR Department, in particular at CSR Network 
Committee meetings. 
The Group CSR Department relies on a network of 
CSR officers in each region who drive and implement 
the Group’s CSR strategy at the local level. Together 
they form a global team of CSR professionals from 
diverse cultures.
Each year, the Group reassesses its membership in 
various professional groups and industry networks 
and, in particular, ensures that their objectives are 
consistent with the Group’s values and are in line 
with its CSR strategy. 
The Group supports ambitious climate legislation, such 
as the European Commission’s Fit-for-55 regulatory 
package, which aims to reduce net greenhouse 
gas emissions by 2030 by at least 55% below 1990 
levels. It includes the FuelEU maritime regulation, 
which aims to regulate greenhouse gas reductions 
and extend the European Union Emissions Trading 
Scheme to maritime transport. 
The Group also encourages the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) to strengthen its objectives 
and associated measures to decarbonise maritime 
transport.
The Group CSR Committee, which is chaired by Rodolphe Saadé and coordinated by the Group CSR 
Department, was created in 2021. This committee meets once a month. It involves the Group Executive 
Committee members most concerned by CSR issues. It is the main forum for defining and monitoring 
 
the Group’s strategy, actions, partnerships and key CSR performance indicators to ensure that the Group’s 
CSR objectives are met.

CSR strategy action plan
In connection with its process to structure its actions, the CSR 
teams have been strengthened in order to define trajectories, 
priorities, quantified objectives and action plans, and to coordinate 
and provide support for projects.
CSR projects are monitored using performance and 
impact indicators that reflect ambitious objectives in 
line with the Group’s 12 priorities. The objectives are 
presented throughout this document in the chapters 
focusing on each priority.
CMA CGM Group intends to respond to the global 
challenges set out in the 17 United Nations (UN) 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted 
in 2015. 
These indicators include performance indicators 
 
(17 for CMA CGM and 13 for CEVA) which have been 
defined and are evaluated each quarter, and which 
are then presented to the Group CSR Committee 
and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
In the event of discrepancies between the objectives 
set and the progress made in achieving them, specific 
action plans are put in place.
"2022 has been a year of significant achievements, with structured, 
high-impact long-term actions. They demonstrate the ambition  
of CMA CGM Group, as partner of choice in the maritime transport 
of containers and logistics sectors, in the area of social and 
environmental responsibilities, for our stakeholders. The Group 
prioritises its strategy around the three pillars of Acting for People, 
Acting for the Planet and Acting for Fair Trade, and set up action 
plans whose implementation is monitored through key performance 
indicators."
CLAIRE MARTIN, 
Group CSR Vice-President
The members of the CSR Committee, together with 
their teams, are responsible for achieving the CSR 
performance objectives. 
All of these actions are regularly reported to 
 
the Board of Directors.
In 2022, the Group adopted a digital reporting tool 
called SAVE (Sustainability Analytics for Vision and 
Empowerment). SAVE offers a more robust process 
for collecting and consolidating our non-financial 
data while enabling us to coordinate our CSR strategy 
through Group objectives and action plans.

1. Protecting employees
Health and safety are top priorities for CMA CGM Group. 
 
The Group’s policy is to protect the health, safety, security and 
well-being of its employees. This policy is based on robust safety 
measures and the deployment of a safety culture improvement 
programme which focuses on prevention through training 
and awareness-raising for each employee. For the health and 
 
well-being of its employees, CMA CGM also implements quality 
of life action plans. Finally, the safety of operations is overseen 
at the highest level and ensured by the emergency management 
system, external audits and certifications, the monitoring and 
analysis of incidents, and the control of hazardous substances. 
"Everyone should be involved in safety matters,  
and this is particularly true on board our ships, at terminals,  
and in our depots. We have implemented the tools and procedures 
necessary to ensure everyone's safety. Nevertheless, it is essential 
to consider our individual actions and to recognise everyday 
situations that, if not properly handled, may lead to accidents.  
The "Leadership on Safety & Security" training course provided  
to the entire Group is an important step towards achieving  
safety excellence." 
FRANCK MAGARIAN, 
Senior Vice-President Operations, QHSE, Ports & Terminals Purchasing
As of 31 December 2022, the Group had 87,714* employees, including 
6,586 seafarers and 115 pilots. In 2022, new hires totalled 29,886 and there 
were 24,317 departures. 
SAFETY CULTURE IN MARITIME ACTIVITIES
Health and safety risk management is a continuous improvement 
process. It involves all actors on a day-to-day basis, from Management 
to seafarers and operational staff, under the guidance of the Accident 
Prevention Committee (APC). This committee is responsible for providing 
feedback on accident investigations and developing prevention 
strategies to improve safety levels.
In conducting its maritime business, CMA CGM follows the most stringent 
accident prevention standards (e.g.: Oil Companies International 
Marine Forum Marine Injury Reporting Guidelines). The methods used 
 
to collect information and classify and report accidents on board vessels 
permits measuring the effectiveness of the systems in place, facilitates 
comparison of safety performance with other shipping companies, 
 
and enables coordinating practices and policies with the aim of reducing 
the frequency of seafarer injuries. 
In order to reduce the risk of accidents, CMA CGM deploys 
 
a "Safety Improvement Plan" for its maritime operations: 
01. 
Individual assessment of officers’ level of awareness of safety at work. 
02. 
Training in safety culture for shore-based staff involved in maritime 
activities and shipboard top management, by recognised industrial 
safety players (Leadership in Safety).  
03. 
On board safety training by working on behaviours using digital 
tools available on each seafarer’s phones or tablets (SAYFR). 
04. 
Training of shipboard management to reduce the risk of accidents 
by helping the crew to anticipate and react to events. 
05. 
Training of maritime staff in onboard firefighting.

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
Each year, CMA CGM conducts a prevention campaign for seafarers 
on the various means of preventing onboard accidents. This campaign, 
called "Safety Barriers", familiarises staff with physical protective 
features, such as alarms and safety devices on equipment, intangible 
protective features, as well as procedures, work permits, behavioural 
reflexes, the right to withdraw in the event of serious and imminent 
danger, and methods for reporting identified risks.
After onboard firefighting training courses, the training companies 
prepare assignment reports containing proposals for improvements in 
equipment, documentation, organisation, training, etc. These reports 
are analysed and form the basis for improvement action plans that are 
regularly reviewed and monitored. 
CMA CGM continuously renews its safety awareness resources for 
seafarers. In connection with its process for sharing feedback about 
onboard events, the Group uses tools such as comic books to reach 
less experienced crew members. 
Safety management is integrated into TOUCH, our fleet management 
tool. The record of daily operations aboard vessels is used to share 
feedback on a weekly basis about accidents that have occurred and 
actions and practices to be encouraged. In order to harmonise and 
improve health and safety practices, the risk analysis and incident 
reporting tool was simplified and digitalised in 2022.
In 2022, the Group launched its "Heading to Safety" safety awareness 
campaign, which focuses on the 12 golden behavioural rules for 
maximising safety in partner shipyards: wearing personal protective 
equipment, risk analysis, prevention attitudes and good practices, 
and the use of tools. 
SAFETY CULTURE AT CEVA LOGISTICS 
CEVA Logistics’ health and safety policy is deployed 
at all levels of the company, and all employees 
are committed to actively contribute to achieving 
 
its objectives. CEVA Logistics has built its safety 
management culture around three levels of 
responsibility:
- site level: operational control and risk management; 
- regional level: facilitation and technical support; 
- 
global level: definition of strategy and objectives, 
systems management and support for certification.
All new employees and subcontractors receive 
safety training. Sites with over 10 employees have 
Health, Safety and Environment Committees. 
 
Site managers conduct a safety inspection of their 
sites each month. Workplace accidents, illnesses 
and incidents are systematically investigated, 
 
the cause is identified and corrective action is taken 
to avoid any recurrence. 
CEVA Logistics is currently digitising the monitoring 
of workplace safety using the Intelex solution. 
 
This tool will make it possible to target more precisely 
the sites identified as the most accident-prone with 
dedicated action plans and to better control major 
risks. Initially deployed in the United Kingdom, starting 
in 2023, Intelex will be progressively extended to 
 
the other countries in which the Group does business. 
SAFETY CULTURE FOR TERMINAL, 
INLAND AND LOGISTICS ACTIVITIES 
The risk mapping of shore-based, logistics and terminal 
activities has identified 10 Critical Risk Standards 
(CRS): natural disasters, fires and explosions, collisions, 
cargo handling, falls from heights, the environment, 
ships and inland transport, maintenance/energy, 
security, occupational health and safety.
Each site applies a management approach to these 
10 critical risks, is covered by a prevention and control 
method, and is equipped with the necessary tools 
 
to prepare an action plan adapted to local, regulatory, 
environmental and operational specificities. 
 
An incident reporting and analysis mobile application 
provides the transparency and responsiveness 
required when a risk materialises. The sites establish 
a safety culture and raise awareness among their 
employees through a dedicated safety talks called 
the "Toolbox Meeting".
The weekly safety report shares good practices and 
the analysis of significant events in order to improve 
the safety culture. A monthly report includes safety 
initiatives, as well as environmental initiatives, 
 
site performance updates and accident reports, 
thus providing an overview of the achievements 
of the terminals and shore-based sites to further 
 
the continuous improvement process. 
In 2022, the Group extended to site managers and 
safety officers its "Leadership in Safety" training 
course, which was given last year to onboard officers. 
The "Leadership in Safety" training was rolled out 
in 2022 to HSE managers and directors of terminal 
and inland sites.

The Fleet Centre monitors, in real time, all movements of the worldwide fleet of vessels operated 
by CMA CGM. A 20-screen panoramic display has been installed which provides the team with 
features such as live monitoring of ship manoeuvres. This enables the crisis unit adjacent to the 
control room to interact via videoconference with the ships’ commanders for faster and more 
efficient decision-making.

On land, the Group is deploying an approach 
 
to prevent and manage three types of major risks: 
- 
security risks due to factors such as geopolitics 
and crime; 
- health risks, such as pandemics or medical evacuations; 
- 
natural and industrial hazards, such as earthquakes, 
cyclones, tornadoes, typhoons and floods. 
IN SLOVAKIA, GEFCO AUTOMATES 
STOCK-TAKING USING DRONES
GEFCO deploys drones to check stocks at its 
warehouse in Trnava, Slovakia. Originally, 
 
the drones covered one third of the floor area of 
the warehouse for an automotive customer, but 
this successful experiment has now been extended 
 
to the entire warehouse. Deploying these drones 
met two needs: ensuring the safety of employees 
and speeding up the performance of this task. 
 
These drones will replace the handling work of staff 
who used to perform stock-taking using forklifts; 
they will control inventory in the entire warehouse 
annually and conduct monthly checks in designated. 
SAFETY CULTURE AT AIR CARGO
CMA CGM Air Cargo provides training for its employees 
enabling them to become more comfortable in their 
jobs and to develop their skills. This training is also 
a tool for extending the safety culture in operations 
on a day-to-day basis.
AIR CREWS
When hired, each pilot undergoes regulatory ground 
training. Simulator sessions are also held to confirm 
 
the pilot’s level of proficiency. The pilot will then operate 
flight segments under an instructor’s supervision. 
Subsequently, as their career progresses, periodic 
checks are carried out every six months.
B-777 and A-330 aircraft type rating conversion 
courses are also provided for pilots who lack these 
ratings when hired.
GROUND STAFF 
Air cargo has an Operation Control Centre (OCC) 
with a 24/7 team that supervises flights in real time. 
When hired, shift supervisors (who coordinate operations) 
and flight dispatchers are trained to ensure proper 
shift performance and implementation of operations: 
flight preparation, weather, flight execution.
 The correct application of the procedures is regularly 
checked by the internal compliance teams and 
 
to complement this, quality controls are carried 
out internally to ensure the correct functioning 
 
and respect of the procedures. 
The Maintenance Coordination Centre (MCC) teams, 
which supervise all aircraft maintenance operations, 
also take 777 type rating qualifying courses to gain 
a better understanding of the aircraft.
Training was also provided to obtain airport 
 
authorisations for relevant employees.
Ensuring the health and well-being  
of our employees at work
At sea, the Group’s security approach is designed 
to prevent two major risks: 
- piracy and terrorism at sea; 
- 
trafficking: drugs, weapons, counterfeit goods, 
illegal cigarettes. 
Finally, the Group ensures the security of its employees 
on business trips. CMA CGM and CEVA Logistics 
have set up a dedicated platform for the Group’s 
business travellers. It assists travellers in preparing 
their trips and facilitates rapid intervention by 
 
the Group’s Central Security Division in the event of 
an emergency (security event, natural disaster, etc.). 
In addition, an e-learning programme dedicated 
 
to travel security has been developed and distributed 
to the entire Group. It discusses the full range of good 
practices to follow before and during a trip abroad. 
SOCIAL DIALOGUE  
GROUP POLICY
In accordance with the conventions of the International 
Labour Organization (ILO) and the principles set 
out in its ethical charter, the Group is committed 
to respecting the right to organise and the rules of 
association in the various countries in which it does 
business. CMA CGM Group supports a harmonious, 
respectful and constructive social dialogue in all 
its labour-management bodies in accordance with 
applicable local rules. Social dialogue is an essential 
component of the life of the company. A major 
element is keeping employees informed. Strategy, 
economics, finance, and social and organisational 
issues are discussed in the various bodies in which 
staff representatives and Management participate.
SOCIAL DIALOGUE IN FRANCE  
CMA CGM 
In accordance with applicable laws, in 2022, 
 
the employee representative bodies (Works Council, 
Workplace Health, Safety and Security Committee 
 
and Employee Representatives) were merged into 
a single body: the Social and Economic Committee 
(SEC). 
In addition to the SECs set up in each establishment, 
a Group Committee and a Central Social and 
Economic Committee (CSEC) have been created in 
France, along with the Health, Safety and Working 
Conditions Committees (CSSCT) and various labour-
management committees that focus on specific 
labour-management dialogue issues.
02 - ACTIONS AND COMMITMENTS

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
A regular dialogue is held between staff representatives 
and Management. 
In France, an agreement on trade union rights and 
social dialogue was negotiated and signed by all 
representative trade unions in 2022, as well as an 
agreement on the addition of five green funds to 
the Group Savings Plan, and another on mandatory 
annual negotiations for 2023.
CMA CGM SOCIAL DIALOGUE 
UNITED STATES  
Internationally, social dialogue takes place according 
to local specificities. For example, in the United States, 
CMA CGM has signed 10 collective agreements, 
covering over 20,000 dockworkers, office workers 
and seafarers who work in areas such as handling, 
terminals, maintenance and repair, as well as shipping-
related activities in various ports in the United States. 
In September, APL reached an agreement with 
 
the unions of the Seafarers International Union, 
Pacific Division (SIU/SUP/MFOW) that work on the 
nine US-flagged vessels in our fleet. The company 
worked with its union partners and engaged in 
productive negotiations that maintained job security, 
improved pension and health benefits, and granted 
wage increases. All unions ratified these agreements, 
which came into force on 1 October 2022 and will 
continue until 30 September 2024. 
Further negotiations are ongoing, and will probably 
continue until 2023. 
MARITIME SOCIAL DIALOGUE
In France, the representatives and social partners are 
convened quarterly or for extraordinary meetings 
in the event of an emergency. A specific committee 
within the SEC focuses on health, safety and working 
conditions. It reports on safety performance indicators 
and the regulatory watch on employment issues, 
 
and presents actions taken by CMA CGM to improve 
the working conditions of seafarers. 
The social partners are also given the right to make 
onboard ship visits and report problems encountered 
by seafarers. The social dialogue framework allows 
for free discussion with Management.
The social partners are members of the Quality 
of Life Aboard Committee. It meets periodically 
 
to discuss the progress of actions. 
The work undertaken with the social partners 
concerning French seafarers serves as a basis for our 
teams to disseminate good practices and actions 
internationally.
A COMPETITIVE  
REMUNERATION POLICY 
To attract, retain and motivate its employees, 
 
the Group has a remuneration policy that focuses 
on four priorities:
- internal fairness
- external competitiveness
- remuneration of performance
- the care and protection of our employees
CMA CGM Group conducts a global process that 
evaluates and aims to harmonise the Group’s salary 
policies and structures, as well as its health and 
medical, personal protection and pension insurance 
plans. For example, to ensure that each employee 
is remunerated with a fair wage, CMA CGM Group 
conducts annual external remuneration surveys in 
over 45 countries. Our annual remuneration review 
process is also conducted globally to ensure that 
remuneration in each country is managed fairly and 
consistently with our global principles.
Our philosophy is to care for and protect our 
employees. We are also committed to ensuring that 
each employee has access to a comprehensive benefits 
package, including an adequate level of personal 
protection and medical expenses cover. To achieve 
this goal and improve our offerings, we rely on our 
network of HR professionals and, since 1 December 
2018, have been assisted by an international broker, 
who now covers 80 countries, to negotiate policies 
or policy renewals for the Group (death/permanent 
disability and healthcare insurance).
PERSONAL PROTECTION AND HEALTH COVER
CMA CGM Group demonstrates and reaffirms its commitment 
 
to providing a level of health and personal protection cover for all 
Group employees that is in line with market practice within its business 
sector, and that takes into account local and regional specificities, 
 
as well as our minimum base cover requirements.
For example, CMA CGM and CEVA Logistics ensure that all their 
employees have access to reimbursements of medical expenses, either 
through the government social security system or through the health 
cover offered by the company. 
In addition, CMA CGM and CEVA Logistics employees are covered by 
a personal protection plan, which enables them to protect their families 
against the financial consequences in the event of the employee’s death.
TELEWORKING
In 2022, our international subsidiaries continued to apply the right 
 
to telework two days a week following a collective agreement reached 
at the head office. CMA CGM has supported this development: 
maintaining connections between employees, paying attention 
 
to the proper use of digital tools, training in hybrid working methods, 
 
and assisting managers in managing remote teams. 
HEALTH AND WELL-BEING AT WORK
CMA CGM supports its employees in their managerial practices, 
 
in particular through stress management workshops. 
A psychological assistance system provides employees with one 
psychologist in Marseille and a telephone hotline. 
At the Group’s head office in Marseille, employees have access 
 
to a break room and a fitness room that offers a wide range of activities: 
yoga, dance, meditation and indoor sports sessions of varying intensity. 
In North America, a 360-degree programme offers support to employees: 
general well-being, physical fitness, mental health, financial management. 
Employees have access to a mental wellness app (Headspace) 
 
and wellness leave. 
At the CEVA Logistics head office in Marseille, a "flex-office" tool 
has also been set up. This tool distributes employees on open-space 
platforms and ensures closer collaboration between teams since 
 
the end of the lockdown periods. Soundproof booths have been 
installed on the platforms to provide greater confidentiality.

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
WELL-BEING ABOARD
The Group complies with the Maritime Labour 
Convention, which enshrines fundamental rights, such 
as the elimination of discrimination and respect for 
employees. In its Code of Ethics, the Group guarantees 
the rights of each employee and undertakes to prohibit 
discrimination of any kind, whether based on social 
or national origin, race, gender, sexual orientation, 
age, political opinions, religious beliefs or any other 
grounds. The Group therefore opposes all types 
 
of psychological, physical and sexual harassment 
and promotes gender equality. 
The teams on board ships are offered:
- counselling, available in several languages
- contact with the occupational psychologist
- 
the right to contact a Psychosocial Risk officer on 
board (for French seafarers)
- 
access to the system in place for filing complaints, 
which is managed by the Group’s expert services
The Group’s formal complaints management procedure 
regularly monitors and analyses complaints. Teams 
at the head office provide regular follow-up and 
ensure remediation and prevention. Complaints are 
tracked by nationality and by category of complaint, 
and their status is updated in each report.
The Group is particularly committed to providing 
support for seafarers through improved management 
of on-board periods, workload analysis, exchanges 
between shore staff and seafarers, and monitoring 
and alert procedures focusing on the handling 
 
of psychosocial risks. 
A self-assessment of human rights on board was carried 
out this year to provide a global picture of the working 
conditions of on-board teams. The Group took part 
in the "Responsible Shipping Dialogue" discussions 
launched at the end of 2021 by the international 
organisations RightShip, Institute for Human Rights 
and Business and Sustainable Shipping Initiative, 
together with other industry players. In connection 
with its health and safety policy, the Group initiated 
an independent survey of crews onboard to assess 
well-being and reduce psychosocial risks on board. To 
improve the quality of life and well-being on board, 
a 10-point action plan has been adopted. Several 
departments and crews onboard representatives 
are working together to implement the action plan. 
 
 
Ensuring the safety  
of operations
OPERATIONAL SAFETY PROGRAMMES
The Group has a robust and effective safety programme, which is 
coordinated by the senior management of the organisation and 
 
at all levels: Management, employees and stakeholders. 
In 2022, CMA CGM’s safety priority is to centralise the management 
of emergency situations to ensure appropriate action and immediate 
responsiveness adapted to each situation. This approach is aligned 
with the Group’s risk mapping. 
CMA Ships carries out internal audits and has appointed an outside 
organisation to carry out external Quality-Health-Safety-Environment 
(QHSE) audits of its ships, which are standardised on the basis 
 
of a list of audit points. In addition to these audits, CMA Ships assesses 
the condition of each vessel on a weekly basis and reports the results 
to Management. 
CEVA Logistics’ safety management system is built on a standard 
approach that aims for excellence while allowing for a certain flexibility. 
The health and safety reference framework is designed to guide the HSE 
network towards convergence on a base that meets the requirements 
of the ISO 45001 standard, which certifies occupational health and 
safety practices. This "base" will then be supplemented in accordance 
with local contexts. 
INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATIONS
Adopting international standards enables the Group to operate more 
efficiently, to make its processes more reliable and to deliver high-
quality service. In particular, the Group deploys certifications for its 
management systems: ISO 9001 for quality, ISO 14001 for the environment, 
 
and ISO 45001 for occupational health and safety. 
CEVA Logistics also implements sector-specific standards based 
 
on a modular approach that meets needs on a case-by-case basis: 
ISO 27001 standards for information security, EN 9100 for aeronautics, 
GxP Pharma and ISO 13485 for medical devices, IATF/TS 16949 for 
 
the automotive industry and ISO 50001 for energy management 
In 2021, CEVA Logistics was the first company in the world to receive 
the IATA CEIV certification for the transport of lithium batteries for its 
Amsterdam and Hong Kong sites. In 2022, CEVA Logistics extended 
this expertise to five other stations: Frankfurt, Incheon, Shanghai (PVG), 
Singapore and Tokyo. As a result, the global network is prepared 
 
to transport and store lithium batteries, whether for the automotive, 
healthcare or technology industries.

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
MONITORING OF INCIDENTS
CMA CGM has set up incident investigation procedures that are 
subject to continuous improvement. They cover: behavioural analysis, 
feedback, training, e-learning, best practice and awareness campaigns
CMA CGM monitors incidents, i.e. events that impact the health 
and safety of people and equipment or that have environmental or 
financial impacts.
We sadly report that three fatal accidents occurred in 2022. As a 
responsible company and employer, we owe a duty to analyse the causes 
of these incidents in order to eliminate risk factors and behaviours: 
- I
n early November, a CMA Ships employee died in Thailand during 
the installation of a crane on board;
- 
In late November, a CMA Ships employee in Morocco died on a 
vessel during port operations;
- 
In December, a CEVAemployee died of injuries sustained in November 
from an explosion at a client site in Dubai. 
Each of these incidents was investigated on site and in detail, 
and plans to improve protective measures were disseminated and 
implemented within the teams:
- 
Procedures: Strengthening equipment inspection and safety procedures 
(including marking risk areas);
- 
Communication: Alerts issued to check all potentially dangerous 
situations at all sites concerned, specific communication on safety 
conditions and applicable procedures, and increased focus on ensuring 
proper transmission of safety procedures, particularly in the event of 
staff turnover;
- 
Actions: Psychological support, sites with similar conditions identified, 
action plans jointly developed with employees at the site in order to 
implement the most appropriate measures. 
RESCUE OPERATIONS
he entire maritime industry works together to save lives. It may be 
necessary, at any time, to divert ships to come to the aid of a vessel 
in distress.
International search and rescue (SAR) organisations investigate and 
organise concerted assistance to persons in distress or imminent danger. 
Shipping companies are regularly called upon to assist in the rescue 
of life at sea by the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC). 
In addition, CMA CGM Group is a member of Automated Mutual 
Assistance Vessel Rescue (AMVER), a worldwide voluntary reporting 
system sponsored by the United States Coast Guard (USCG).
In 2022, CMA CGM vessels  
carried out 12 rescue operations at sea.

CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
In compliance with local and international laws and 
regulations, CEVA Logistics’ hazardous materials 
policy governs the acceptance, handling, storage 
and transportation of dangerous goods. 
Training is a key component of CEVA Logistics’ 
approach to dealing with hazardous materials. 
Employees who are exposed to dangerous goods 
receive specific training. In addition, all cargo handling 
sites must have at least two International Air Transport 
Association (IATA) certificates and two members 
 
of staff who have received the International Maritime 
Dangerous Goods (IMDG) training. 
CMA CGM Group transports a wide variety of cargoes, 
some of which may present a risk during shipment. 
A specialised team inspects, analyses and acts 
 
to prevent these risks. CMA CGM also has a specialised 
application for handling dangerous goods. It is tied 
into the global reservation system and incorporates 
international regulatory requirements, thus enabling 
verification of the declaration and handling of goods.
In addition, CMA CGM makes every effort to prevent 
the illegal transport of goods, in accordance with 
the law and its code of ethics. The Group uses 
 
a system capable of detecting hazardous materials 
that have not been declared as such (Safety Cargo 
Control or SCC).

Acting for people
2. Promoting education  
and training
CMA CGM Group is committed to involving its employees in 
 
its transformation, sharing its strategy with them and listening 
 
to them through an engagement survey. To accelerate 
 
the professional development of each employee, CMA CGM 
and CEVA Logistics operate a harmonised career management 
system. The Group is also committed to supporting each person 
to develop their skills: employees, managers, apprentices, etc.
"2022 was another exceptional year for CMA CGM Group,  
in terms of results and growth. 
As a Human Resources team, our priority is to be at the service  
of our now 150,000 employees worldwide. They are at the heart 
of the Group’s success and, through their commitment, hold the key 
to our transformation. It will be thanks to them that the Group  
will be able to successfully meet the challenges our businesses face, 
at a time when the key issues of innovation, cybersecurity,  
green energy and more responsible transport are on everyone's mind.
In 2022, we continued to roll out a common HR policy for our 
divisions Shipping, Logistics and Air Cargo by deploying a common 
talent management and development process backed by  
the same digital platform.
 
These policies will be continued in 2023, with the same watchword: 
‘Increasing our attractiveness and the development and retention  
of our employees and talents’ through an ambitious roadmap  
that will continue to bring out the full potential of our employees 
and contribute to their professional development."

FIRST ENGAGEMENT SURVEY:  
WE LISTEN & ACT
The Group appointed an external company to conduct its first 
anonymous engagement survey of 70,000 employees (CMA CGM and 
CEVA*). "VoiceYourOpinion" had a Group-wide response rate of 84%. 
 
The Group obtained an engagement rate of 73, a very satisfactory score 
for a first survey compared to the benchmark for our business sector. 
The results of the Group were shared with all employees. 
At Group level, three strengths points were reported:
- 
Challenging the status quo: employees feel free to challenge 
 
the way things are done. 
- 
Take Action: employees feel confident that actions will be taken 
 
as a result of the survey. 
- Responsability: employees feel responsible for the work they perform. 
Three opportunities for improvement emerged from the survey:
- 
Communication: employees recognise the efforts and improvement 
made for greater communication, but they consider that communication 
is essentially top down and would like to feel greater proximity 
 
to top management. 
- 
Equal Opportunity: employees expressed the need for greater 
transparency in career management and more clarity about the tools 
available to enable them to be more proactive. 
- 
Belonging: employees expressed a strong sense of belonging at 
 
the local entity level, but less so at Group level.  
The Group has prepared a two-year action plan, which has been shared 
with all employees. It aims to set up and coordinate initiatives on 
 
the improvement opportunities at all levels of the organisation.

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
The Group is committed to engaging its employees 
 
by communicating and sharing information on 
 
strategic, economic, financial, corporate and 
organisational matters and about social and 
 
sustainable development issues. This communication 
is regularly and transparently provided through: 
- the Group’s website;
- the intranet and videos posted by managers;
- 
the weekly news flash (articles, interviews, videos, 
etc.) and the CEVA Monday Catch Up;
- 
CEVA Logistics’ in-house monthly magazine 
 
"The Chain"
- 
in-house webinars in which our CEO discusses 
 
the Group’s strategy and ambitions;
- internal memoranda. 
CMA CGM Group has created an immersive escape 
game played in teams for new hires. This game, which 
has already been tested in China, India, the United 
States, Singapore, Lebanon and France, enables 
players to discover the Group, its history, its values, 
its organisation and its businesses. A digital version 
is being created to provide all employees with 
 
the opportunity to access this training. 
HARMONISATION OF CAREER 
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES  
AND TOOLS
Accelerating employee development
In 2022, CMA CGM and CEVA Logistics harmonised 
their career management processes, and extended 
them to the recently acquired entities (Ingram Micro 
CLS, GEFCO, Colis Privé). This process identifies 
talents, proposes development goals, and provides 
access to training programmes and global mobility 
opportunities. 
As a further step, CMA CGM merged the human 
resources information systems of CMA CGM and 
CEVA Logistics. The new platform (MyHR) groups 
the new HR processes, such as talent reviews and 
performance reviews. It is gradually being expanded 
to the Group’s new companies.  
DEPLOYMENT OF THE KEY SKILLS 
DATABASE  
To support the transformation and performance of 
all divisions of the Group, CMA CGM has developed 
a database of 56 key skills. The key skills database 
has been integrated into all development tools and 
programmes and is used for the assessment and 
development of employees. Each employee will be 
able to refer to it when our new performance process 
is deployed in early 2023, and use it to become 
aware, in a transparent manner, of the skills to be 
developed in order to progress within the Group.
LEADERSHIP AND EXPERTS 
PROGRAMMES AT GROUP LEVEL  
The Group continues the structuring of its leadership 
programmes. They are essential for preparing and 
equipping the leaders of today and tomorrow 
 
to carry out the transformation and support the 
strong growth of the Group. They are broken down 
by management level:  
- 
"Expand" programme for top management, 
 
in partnership with the IESE Business School; 
- 
"Excelerate" programme for middle management, 
which was opened to the whole Group in 2022 
 
and had 36 participants this year; 
- 
"Explore" programme for first-level management, 
which is under development and will be completely 
digital and use an innovative and disruptive approach. 
SUPPORT  
FOR GENERAL MANAGERS  
The General Manager School (GM School) assists 
CMA CGM’s Agency Managers to develop their 
business and leadership skills and their careers. 
 
It was redesigned last year to introduce the concept 
of key skills and, in 2022, was opened to branch, 
warehouse and terminal managers. Spread over 
two months, the programme offers virtual and 
 
in-person learning, as well as meetings, workshops 
and a self-assessment debriefed by certified in-house 
professionals, which enable managers to understand 
their strengths and points to develop. CMA CGM 
 
has developed a complementary course to assist 
General Managers in dealing with the specific 
challenges of their activities, including a CSR module. 
It will be made available in 2023. 
With this programme, the Group aims to:
- 
improve management practices to maximise 
 
the performance of the Group’s entities; 
- 
increase business alignment by exposing managers 
to ComEx members and top management;
- 
strengthen the CMA CGM network and form 
 
an internal community.
This year, the third promotion of the GM School 
was composed of 24 participants, of which 25% 
were women and 76% were non-French (20 different 
nationalities). 
CEVA, CMA CGM Group’s leading subsidiary, 
made three major acquisitions this year ( Ingram 
Micro CLS, GEFCO, Colis Privé) and has set up 
a specific integration programme for these new 
employees: 
- a tool for welcoming new employees at the local level; 
- 
a visit by Rodolphe Saadé, Chairman and CEO, 
 
to the headquarters of these new acquisitions; 
- 
organisation of change management and facilitation 
on transformation projects, team building and 
creativity. 
SHARING THE GROUP’S STRATEGY AND TRANSFORMATION
In addition, in 2022, CMA CGM continued to deploy 
an individual skills and motivation assessment tool, 
an e-coaching programme using the Moovone 
platform for the Group’s local managers, and various 
solutions to accelerate the career development 
 
of our employees, including the creation of a project 
team on mobility issues expected in 2023.
THE CMA CGM ACADEMY  
OFFERS TRAINING FOR ALL  
The CMA CGM Academy offers consequential and 
qualitative training. It is available to all employees 
CMA CGM and offers solutions adapted to each 
individual. All in-person training offered is now also 
available in virtual classrooms. Some training courses 
are also offered as e-learning. 
The Group offers over 537 virtual classroom courses, 
such as "Assertiveness & Communication", "Change 
for Managers", "Introduction to Supply Chain 
Activities", "Our Company’s Values" and "The 
Customer Experience". 
In 2022, CMA CGM continued to digitalise its 
training system and to make it more international. 
This new training management tool, which is already 
available in CMA CGM Group, will soon be deployed 
within CEVA Logistics. Guide Me, a contextual help 
solution, will also be directly integrated into some 
of the Group’s flagship tools.
TRAINING FOR MARITIME 
TRANSPORT JOBS
In-house trainers provide training in the jobs 
specific to the Group’s maritime transport business: 
 
sales representatives, ship managers, etc. One of 
 
the Academy’s priorities is to coordinate a community 
of in-house trainers. This covers recruitment, 
training, coaching and the creation of peer-to-peer 
discussion periods focused on sharing experiences, 
strengthening commitment and increasing skills. 
 
An internal recruitment event, "Trainers Wanted", 
was organised at the head office this year.

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
Since 2021, the Group has been providing "Leadership 
in Safety" training for QHSE managers in the maritime 
business and senior on-board officers. In 2022, 
 
this training was deployed to the QHSE managers 
of shore-based activities and the managers of 
 
the shore-based sites (terminals and depots). 
The operation of ships powered by liquefied natural 
gas (LNG) requires crews to acquire new skills. Under 
international regulations, seafarers on board ships 
subject to the IGF international safety code must 
receive mandatory training in order to embark on 
such ships. Depending on their rank, seafarers must 
complete the training and hold a basic or advanced 
certificate. Over 1,500 seafarers have been trained 
at the basic level and over 600 at the advanced 
level. Exceeding the requirements of international 
regulations, the Group has set up additional training 
courses which have been taken by over 300 seafarers. 
Ongoing training of seafarers is also provided by 
 
the Seagull OLP platform, which offers regularly 
updated training (e-learning). This platform also 
supports the Competence Management System 
(CMS), which forms an integral part of the crew 
members’ career management.
C BOX FACILITATION KITS 
AVAILABLE TO ALL TEAMS  
The Group has created facilitation kits designed 
 
to help teams stimulate their collective intelligence, 
strengthen their cohesion and solve specific problems. 
These kits, called C-Boxes, assist teams to organise 
workshops independently. Nine C-Boxes are already 
available: Team, Change, Creativity, Diversity, 
Feedback, Welcome Back, Sustainability, Better 
Ways and Digital.
To promote this solution, the CMA CGM Academy 
organised two "C-Box Days" at the head office. Over 
a hundred employees expressed an interest and will 
be assisted in facilitating one or more workshops 
independently.
In 2022, the Group provided 872,259 hours of 
training (CMA CGM + CEVA Logistics). The target 
for training is 3 days of training per employee 
per year in 2022. The target was achieved within 
 
CMA CGM with 3,65 days of training per person. 
At CEVA Logistics, employees receive an average 
of 0,77 days of training per year.
TRAINING FOR MARITIME  
AND SHORE-BASED EMPLOYEES
The safety of seafarers requires specific and adapted 
training. In addition to regulatory and mandatory 
training, the Group has a matrix of additional specific 
training, some of which is required prior to crew 
members’ first boarding. 
An integration day, in line with the CMA CGM 
Academy integration programme, is held for new 
seafarers, and will be extended to all seafarers in 
the near future. 
CMA CGM has trained its seafarers in the use of 
SAYFR, a digital security awareness solution with 
over 5,000 users, which includes two modules: 
 
SAYFR WE2D, which can be used at the individual 
level to simulate real-life situations and behaviours, 
and SAYFR Team for team activities. SAYFR focuses 
on behaviours and sharing good practices, and aims 
to make every incident a starting point for strategic 
thinking.
The Group is in the process of rolling out internationally 
a one-day training course covering on-board 
psychosocial risks. French seafarers who have taken 
this training course will supplement it with two 
days of additional training to become psychosocial 
risk reference persons in order to provide support 
 
to teams aboard vessels. 
ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT  
OF YOUNG TALENT
The Group pays particular attention to young talent and coordinates 
 
a community of 150 interns and work-placement staff in France.
Each year, the Group hires over 50% of its interns and apprentices 
during their final year of study. They are seen as a talent pool and 
 
an investment in the future. 
CMA CGM’s main objective is to maintain diversity in recruitment. 
 
The Group hires candidates with international profiles (34%) and a variety 
of educational backgrounds: 57% of them have graduated from business 
schools, 18% from engineering schools and 25% from political studies 
institutes or universities. 
Since 2022, the CMA CGM Academy trains tutors of interns and work-
placement staff to familiarise them with their supervisory and training role.
All identified talents undergo a specific development programme: 
training in leadership, coaching, mentoring and internal sponsoring. 
CMA CGM updates its succession plans annually. 
For the seventh year in a row, CMA CGM Group has been awarded 
the Happy Index®Trainees certification, which rewards the quality of 
internships and work-placement contracts. Around 90% of respondents 
would recommend the Group for an internship or work placement.
TRAINING APPRENTICES IN AVIATION  
AND MARITIME TRADES
The Group also continued the TAMM air and sea freight transport 
programme in France.
This training is designed for young Master’s graduates who wish 
 
to develop expertise in the transport and logistics field. 
This one-year programme confers the Air or Maritime Freight Transport 
Organiser certificate, which is registered in the National Roster of 
Professional Certifications, as well as an internal certificate. More than 
three quarters of the graduates of the first two classes were hired 
 
by the Group.
OPENING OUR WORLD TO INTERNATIONAL 
CORPORATE VOLUNTEERS
The Group’s International Corporate Volunteer programme hosts 
around 60 young graduates in France each year. 
This programme is a springboard for young graduates, both on 
 
the external market and within CMA CGM: 60% of corporate volunteers 
are hired at the end of the programme. This programme, which is 
 
already established within CMA CGM, was extended to CEVA Logistics 
in 2022.

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
Raising awareness and engaging employees 
in the Group’s environmental challenges
MY DAILY IMPACT
In 2022, the Group launched MyDailyImpact, a platform 
acting concrete to raise employees’ climate awareness, 
offer them training and propose challenges in order 
to reduce their individual impact. 
Each challenge raises funds for organisations involved 
in environmental conservation. 
The Group has engaged two impact start-ups to 
implement this project : WeNow, a start-up that 
raises awareness and provides training on climate 
issues, and Mão Boa, which specialises in employee 
mobilisation and which was incubated in ZEBOX, 
 
the Group’s start-up incubator. 
A CSR TRAINING PLAN ADAPTED 
TO THE GROUP’S BUSINESSES  
The objective of setting up a CSR training plan 
 
is to raise awareness and train employees in CSR in 
order to prepare them for the evolutions that climate 
change will bring to their jobs. This will also help 
 
to meet certain regulatory requirements. The factors 
identified in the risk map, combined with the needs 
relevant to CSR issues pinpointed during a review 
of the situation, contributed to the construction of 
the Group’s CSR training plan. This plan is based 
on the three priorities of the Group’s CSR strategy.
- 
Logistics in crisis situations to define and adapt 
 
the role of logistics in the event of a crisis and to 
adjust flows during natural disasters or wars. 
- 
Transforming the world of work to adapt to its 
changes and create an inclusive, egalitarian and 
diverse environment. 
TANGRAM is a catalyst designed to create a rich 
ecosystem and develop synergies between experts 
in all areas: CMA CGM Group employees, start-ups, 
customers and partners, major companies, research 
centres, universities, competitors, etc. 
The project is already active through "Powered by 
TANGRAM" training courses, university chairs and 
partnerships with start-ups that offer technologies 
such as disruptive mobility. In January 2024, a new 
venue will host all these projects at a prestigious 
location at La Pointe Rouge in Marseille.
This year, CMA CGM launched My Climate 
School, the cornerstone of this new training plan. 
 
In partnership with AXA Climate, this programme 
includes two types of modules.
- 
The "Understanding" modules present the scientific 
fundamentals of global warming, its impact on 
biodiversity, and the need to think about it systemically.
- 
The "Action" modules deal with the impact of the 
climate transition on the company’s activities: carbon 
footprint, climate strategy, circular economy, etc. 
and how to integrate the climate into the various 
business lines.
Eight modules are available for the Group’s IT, legal, 
finance, marketing and communication, responsible 
purchasing, human resources, risk management, 
 
and corporate services functions.
TANGRAM, the new training  
and innovation centre for the sustainable 
transport and logistics of tomorrow.
CMA CGM Group has established TANGRAM, a new 
centre of excellence open to all parties who wish 
 
to collaborate to create the sustainable transport and 
logistics of tomorrow. Its goal is to make a pivotal 
contribution to the transport and logistics sectors 
 
in response to the major challenges facing the world 
today (environmental, societal, geopolitical, etc.). 
It is based on two interconnected priorities, 
training and innovation, and aims to respond to 
seven major challenges: 
- 
Decarbonisation and preserving biodiversity by 
researching and developing sustainable mobility 
solutions based on renewable energy. 
- 
Digitalisation and technological innovation to 
anticipate the future by developing new solutions: 
autonomous vehicles, robotics, metaverse, smart 
data, AI and new ways to grow businesses. 
-
 
Exploiting the potential of the space industry 
 
to optimise existing means of transport by creating 
orbital logistics projects. 
- 
Changes in consumption patterns to adapt 
 
to changes in society and consumption habits 
in order to be more in tune with the needs and 
expectations of the Group’s customers. 
-
 
Geopolitical developments to closely monitor 
geopolitical tensions and anticipate the impact 
 
of a new global balance on logistics flows.
CMA CGM commits to endowing a "Sustainability and Supply Chain Analytics" Chair at HEC Paris. 
This Chair, which will be headed by a professor from the business school and will be coordinated 
by TANGRAM, will develop knowledge on supply chain sustainability based on analyses of 
 
the Group's operational data. Over the next three years, the Chair will hold workshops and 
conferences and will publish articles on a regular basis. This Chair also includes a recruitment 
component overseen by Human Resources, which will enable HEC students to learn more about 
our Group and potentially join it.

within the Group and in its business sectors.  
Raising awareness and training
Commitment to gender  
balance
WORLDWIDE ACTIONS FOR PARITY
Nearly 50 actions in 45 countries carried out to mark the International 
Women’s Rights Day on 8 March. In Spain and Italy, two top women 
athletes, including an Olympic medallist, shared their stories.
In North America, Morocco and Belgium, gender balance awareness-
raising workshops were held on international women’s, human and 
family rights days. 
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the entities created and rolled out 
a diversity and inclusion toolbox and a programme to inspire women 
to become future leaders: "Empowering women to lead". They also 
launched the Girls Network project, which provides a mentoring 
programme for young women in local communities. The mentoring 
sessions are facilitated by female employees of the Group and continue 
for at least a year.
CMA CGM is a partner of the Women’s Forum
CMA CGM partnered with women forum, which organised his 
 
17th edition. Tanya Saadé Zeenny, Executive Vice-President of 
 
the Group, participated in a round table on skills and education in 
the race for humanity. She paid tribute to the women of the Group 
and to all those who were present beside her. Christine Cabau, 
 
Vice-President Assets and Operations, participated in the round 
table on sustainability: "Concrete Targets for Sustainable Corporate 
Action". Several women from the group who are active in various 
leadership programmes were also present: Claire Martin, CSR Vice-
President, Isabelle Thizy, Vice-President Finance and Transverse Projects 
 
and Marketa Pospechova, Chief of Staff.
35% of employees are women. Our employees hold over 175 nationalities and are from 160 countries. 
 
The average age of our employees is 39. The average length of service with the Group is 6 years.
*The People Review is a review of teams/colleagues that offers a unique forum for managers and top management to exchange views 
on the potential and career development prospects of employees who have been identified as key for the company, and to put in place 
action plans (training, etc.).
All of CMA CGM’s leadership programmes incorporate 
inclusion modules. In 2022, the Group continued its 
awareness-raising efforts of diversity and inclusion issues. 
The Group has updated its e-learning courses with 
more attractive, shorter and more interactive formats: 
preventing discrimination and promoting diversity; 
preventing harassment; ethics and compliance. The 
eLearning offer has also been enhanced with training 
and videos to raise awareness of unconscious bias. 
This training, which is intended for recruiters and 
managers, will help to select candidates based on 
objective criteria and thus promote diversity. Finally, 
a training and awareness-raising kit (C-Box Diversity) 
is now available in digital format. It teaches how 
 
to detect possible forms of discrimination and 
 
to plan actions within the teams to promote diversity. 
IN FRANCE: GENDER EQUALITY INDEX  
The gender equality index assesses the differences in pay between 
women and men using several indicators: the pay gap, the gap in pay 
rises and promotions, pay rises after maternity leave, and the percentage 
of women among the 10 highest earners.
In 2022, CEVA Logistics’ head office had a score  
of 84/100 and CMA CGM had a score of 92/100 for France. 
CMA CGM index scored 8 points more in 2022,  
thanks to the criterias on the gap salary analysis.
In 2021, CEVA Logistics’ head office had a score of 79/100 and 
 
CMA CGM had a score of 84/100 for France.

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
Taking disability into  
account in the company
CMA CGM Group is committed to providing support to people who 
need specific assistance during their career. 
At the head office in Marseille, identifying people with disabilities 
 
is usually the task of the Occupational Medicine Department. When 
informed, the Group acts by proposing individual measures to modify, 
adapt or transform the workstation, thereby keeping the persons 
concerned in employment. 
Measures include adapting workstations (footrests, telephone headsets, 
ergonomic chairs, special computer equipment, etc.), providing 
 
an assigned parking space and granting two extra days of leave for 
employees with a disabled child. 
Several actions have been implemented to take the process further, 
such as:
- 
the creation of a dedicated page on the Group’s intranet (objectives, 
definition of disability, process, key contacts);
- the appointment of a disability reference person within the company;
- 
the creation of a dedicated email address to promote discussion 
 
on the subject. 
Promoting inclusion  
CEVA Logistics is committed to hiring  
4,000 employees who have difficulty accessing  
the job market by 2025.
Among the flagship projects within the CEVA group, its subsidiary 
 
GEFCO supports two youth employment non-profit organisations 
by providing financial assistance and encouraging its employees 
 
to become involved in their activities. GEFCO is a partner of Institut 
de l’Engagement, a non-profit organisation that helps young people 
formulate their future plans after a period of volunteer work. Employees 
contributed their expertise and assisted in selecting the candidates. 
The subsidiary is also involved with the Nos Quartiers ont du Talent 
(NQT) non-profit organisation, which assists young graduates 
 
with three years of higher education with their career projects.

4. Supporting  
local communities
CMA CGM Group contributes to the social and economic development 
of the communities in which it does business through the work 
of its Foundation and through initiatives that have a significant 
social and environmental impact, involving its employees whenever 
possible. The initiatives are closely tailored to the needs of local 
areas and communities, and maximise the Group’s local impact. 
Solidarity is expressed in particular in emergency situations: 
 
the war in Ukraine, the economic crisis in Lebanon, extreme weather 
events. The CMA CGM Foundation also continues to provide 
humanitarian aid and to advance its commitment to education for 
all: transporting humanitarian supplies with Containers of Hope, 
food collections, building a school in Côte d’Ivoire, equipping 
schools in Lebanon, and skills-based volunteer work, in particular 
with Le Phare, a social incubator.
- 
100% of countries will have carried out at least one local action with a direct impact on local 
communities and/or areas to contribute to the socio-economic development of the countries 
in which the Group does business through solidarity actions organised by our CSR officers 
around the world and involving our employees. 
- Humanitarian aid and access to education for all through the work of the CMA CGM Foundation. 
Raising awareness  
through action: our teams’  
commitments in favour  
of the environment
CMA CGM employees are committed to the environment on a day-
to-day basis, and organise and participate in regular clean-up events, 
such as World Environment Day on 5 June or World Cleanup Day. 
 
At the most recent World Cleanup Day in 2022, nearly 4,300 employees 
took part in digital and physical clean-ups in 104 countries. Over 
 
42 tonnes of waste were collected. 
In Egypt, on that world day, the Group joined forces with the social 
entrepreneurship organisation Bassita to collect waste on an island 
in the Nile. The local community on the island was then involved in 
upcycling the waste into hats, bags and cases. CMA CGM’s Egypt 
office donated 30 bags to a local orphanage. 
On World Environment Day, the human resources teams at CEVA Logistics’ 
offices and warehouses in India raised awareness among employees 
and their families about ecology and plastic waste management issues. 
Several activities were proposed, such as writing articles or creating 
posters on the subject. 
In Belgium, to promote green mobility, employees were asked to travel 
as many kilometres as possible using alternatives to cars. These total 
kilometres were then converted into CO2 at the end of the month in 
order to provide a clear picture of the concrete impact of these actions 
on the environment.
On World Bicycle Day on 3 June, all employees were invited to 
take part in a programme of events to promote the importance 
of this simple, affordable and environmentally friendly means of 
sustainable transport. In Senegal and Liberia, many employees 
travelled to work by bike. In Singapore, the Philippines, Bangladesh 
 
and Vietnam, the Group’s employees mobilised to collectively cover 
over 2,584 kilometres. 
At the head office, a Bike Forum was held at lunchtime, which included 
repair sessions organised with an external service provider, and at which 
representatives of the city were present, as well as several stakeholders 
in the Marseille bicycle community. In the United States, a donation 
 
of bicycles and tricycles to children in need was organised, as well as 
 
a fundraising event to support research into multiple sclerosis 
 
and cancer.

14. IN ITALY: HUMANITARIAN 
MOBILISATION OF CEVA LOGISTICS 
EMPLOYEES 
In Italy, CEVA Logistics employees can donate hours 
 
of holiday leave to support humanitarian projects. 
 
Some employees took advantage of this time 
 
to organise humanitarian fundraising events. 
 
The Group also provided individual support 
 
to employees involved in solidarity actions, 
 
in particular those who travelled to the Ukrainian 
 
border, in collaboration with NGOs. 
15. IN UKRAINE: CEVA  
LOGISTICS’ TEAMS AT THE SERVICE  
OF HUMANITARIAN AID 
On the different continents, CEVA Logistics teams

population: psychological and financial support, 
donations of essential necessities, etc. 
For example, CEVA Logistics’ team in Pakistan partnered 
with the US Agency for International Development 
(USAID) to deliver relief items to Ukraine. 
CEVA Logistics teams in the Benelux organised 
 
the transport of medical items, fundraising through 
sports activities, and solidarity sales and collections 
in conjunction with specialised NGOs. The Group’s 
sites hosted and assisted Ukrainian truck drivers, 
 
and assisted employees with families in areas 
impacted by the war. 
In Eastern Europe and Germany, CEVA Logistics 
 
issued a memo to all staff to encourage individual 
donations to NGOs. The Group has provided storage, 
handling and distribution facilities for humanitarian 
supplies. Staff organised activities to sponsor 
 
fundraising. On the ground, the teams provided 
humanitarian aid and psychological support 
 
to refugees who arrived in Poland and helped 
 
transport refugees to their relatives in Poland.

of artificial habitats for young fish, thus contributing 
to the development of the CASCIOMAR PROJECT. 
This project, conducted in close collaboration with 
the professional fishermen of Cassis, La Ciotat 
and Marseille, aims to accelerate the resilience 
 
of the marine ecosystem and more specifically 
 
to reboost coastal fish stocks.

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
Acting for people 
The CMA CGM  
Foundation 
The Foundation is an independent body with its own Board 
 
of Directors chaired by Tanya Saadé Zeenny. Since its creation 
 
in 2005 it has supported nearly 400 projects.
Its priority is to promote education for all and equal opportunities 
to enable every child and young person to find their place in 
 
the world of tomorrow. It is particularly committed to supporting 
educational projects with an innovative approach to promote 
 
the inclusion of young people and combat school dropouts. 
It also acts in humanitarian crises requiring an emergency response. 
To do so, it mobilises the maritime and logistical expertise and 
industrial resources of CMA CGM Group to transport humanitarian 
supplies around the world through its humanitarian transport 
programme Containers of Hope, in partnership with NGOs 
 
and international organisations.
Humanitarian aid
CONTAINERS OF HOPE: 
TRANSPORT OF HUMANITARIAN 
SUPPLIES 
Since 2012, the CMA CGM Foundation has operated 
a humanitarian transport programme. Containers 
 
of Hope enables NGOs and international organisations 
to transport humanitarian supplies free of charge 
 
on board CMA CGM Group vessels. 
This programme is carried out in partnership with 
UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Action 
Against Hunger, the French Red Cross, the International 
Committee of the Red Cross, and the Crisis and 
Support Centre (CDCS) of the French Ministry for 
European and Foreign Affairs. In 10 years, over 
20,000 tonnes of humanitarian supplies have been 
delivered to 51 countries.
FIGHTING FOOD INSECURITY 
IN FRANCE 
In response to increased poverty in France, in July 
2022 the Foundation entered into a partnership 
with Banques Alimentaires, a charity that operates 
local food banks, and Restos du Cœur, a charity that 
sets up soup kitchens, to finance the distribution 
 
of 2 million meals in mainland France and in 
 
the French overseas territories. 
In December 2022, an additional partnership was 
signed with the Bouches-du-Rhône branch of Secours 
Populaire, a solidarity-based charity, to support the 
distribution of children’s snacks and fresh produce 
 
to 15,000 families in connection with the Green 
 
Santa Claus operation.   
IN LEBANON 
In the face of an unprecedented crisis in Lebanon 
that has made it increasingly difficult for a growing 
number of Lebanese families to feed themselves, 
140,000 hot meals were distributed during the holiday 
season in partnership with six local associations 
 
and community kitchens.  
EMERGENCY FOOD AID IN AFRICA
In the face of a severe deterioration in the food 
security situation in several African countries due 
to historic droughts, armed conflict and rising world 
food prices, exceptional support was provided 
to finance the distribution of 8 million sachets 
 
of therapeutic food through the nutrition programmes 
of UNICEF in Somalia, Action Against Hunger in 
 
the Democratic Republic of Congo and Doctors 
Without Borders in Nigeria.
AN EXCEPTIONAL MOBILISATION 
FOR UKRAINE
The CMA CGM Foundation participated in the 
international solidarity movement to help the Ukrainian 
civilian population through three large-scale operations 
to transport emergency aid by air, land and sea, 
 
in partnership with the crisis and support centre 
 
of the Ministry for European and Foreign Affairs 
 
and the French Red Cross. 
In March 2022, a CMA CGM AIR CARGO cargo 
plane was made available to transport 55 tonnes 
 
of emergency supplies to Poland.
In July 2022, 60 trucks were mobilised through 
 
CEVA Logistics to transport 900,000 emergency kits 
to Ukraine.      
In September 2022, a CMA CGM Group vessel 
was made available to transport over 1,000 tonnes 
 
of humanitarian aid to Romania.

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
Employee involvement  
in the Foundation’s activities
The Foundation uses skills-based volunteer work 
 
to reinforce the impact of its actions and to support 
its partner non-profit organisations.
In 2022, all CMA CGM employees who volunteered 
were given the opportunity to commit five days 
 
of their working time. 
In total, within the framework of skills sponsorship, 
33 employees participated and contributed their 
expertise to the entrepreneurs working in the 
 
Le Phare incubator, 29 volunteered with the Foundation’s 
partner non-profit organisations with educational 
missions in Marseille and, 59 were mobilised during 
the national food bank collection
Solidarity missions are also organised during 
employees’ personal time in France and Lebanon 
 
to combat food insecurity: 142 employees mobilised 
 
for solidarity actions in Lebanon and, in late 
November, 72 employees participated in the Banques 
 
Alimentaires’ national collection for food banks in 
supermarkets and warehouses in Marseille, Dunkirk, 
Le Havre, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Reunion.
In addition, the Foundation’s projects frequently draw 
on employees’ expertise: coordination of exceptional 
operations, Containers of Hope, etc. Several dozen 
employees provide support for the Foundation’s 
team throughout the year.
Education 
IN CÔTE D’IVOIRE:  
CONSTRUCTION OF A SCHOOL  
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE MAGIC 
SYSTEM FOUNDATION 
The Magic System Foundation promotes the well-
being of the Ivorian population through social actions 
in the fields of education, health, the environment 
and culture. In 2022, the CMA CGM Foundation 
provided financial support for the construction of 
 
a primary school in Port-Bouët, near Abidjan. It also 
donated four containers that, after being converted, 
now house a library and a faculty room. Two hundred 
children in grades 1 to 5 will be enrolled in the school.
IN LEBANON: SCHOOL SUPPLIES 
PROVIDED AND SOLAR PANELS 
INSTALLED IN SCHOOLS 
The Foundation distributed school kits to 9,500 
students from disadvantaged families in 40 schools 
throughout Lebanon. 
The Foundation also financed the installation of solar 
panels in 10 schools to enable the schools to save 
funds and become energy self-sufficient in a context 
of rising energy costs and frequent power cuts.
IN FRANCE: TEACHING YOUNG 
PEOPLE IN MARSEILLE TO SWIM 
For the second consecutive year, the Foundation 
provided financial support for the "One Step Toward 
the Sea" programme run by the Marseille Capitale 
de la Mer non-profit organisation, which offers 
 
150 children in Marseille, between the ages of 6 and 
14, the opportunity to learn to swim in the pools 
of the Cercle des Nageurs de Marseille, a French 
swimming club.
TRAINING FOR SOLAR ENERGY 
JOBS
The Foundation supported the creation of NRSud, 
the Energy Production School of the South, which 
is based in Marseille, and which is the first school 
 
in France to train young people between the ages 
of 15 and 18 for jobs in the solar energy sector. It will 
train solar electricians and cross-functional renewable 
energy technicians. These are jobs of the future, which 
are essential to meet the challenge of the ecological 
transition, and at the same time promote access 
 
to work for young people.
LE PHARE, THE SOCIAL INCUBATOR 
Le Phare, which was created in September 2021, 
 
is a social incubator that provides support, free of 
charge, to entrepreneurs who are developing projects 
with a high social impact in the areas of education 
and promoting access to work. 
These project developers are assisted by CMA CGM 
employees, who offer their expertise according 
to their needs (project management, marketing, 
communication, accounting, legal, human resources, 
etc.). 
They also have access five days a week to a co-
working space set at the Epopée site, an educational 
innovation hub in the heart of the northern districts 
of Marseille. 
A second cohort began working at Le Phare in 
September 2022. Seven projects were chosen by 
a jury: À l’Unisson pour le Futur, Live Love, Mayoo, 
Meet My Mama, Meet Your School, Nanaba and 
Solidarités International. 
To round off this second cohort in Marseille, Le Phare 
will also host successful applicants from Guadeloupe 
and Martinique. They will take part in the programme 
in the new facilities of ZEBOX Caribbean, CMA CGM’s 
incubator and accelerator for innovative start-ups that 
recently opened its doors in Pointe-à-Pitre.

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
Acting for people 
5. Ensuring respect for 
human rights throughout 
the value chain 
Adopted in March 2017, the French Duty of Vigilance Act 
introduced a new legal framework that requires companies within 
its scope, such as CMA CGM Group, to publish a vigilance plan 
and report on the actions implemented in accordance with this 
plan. Going beyond the obligations imposed by the law, our goal 
is to establish a vigilance plan that is consistent with our ethical 
and social commitments. 
This chapter provides an overview of CMA CGM Group’s 2022 
Vigilance Plan, which is available on the Group’s corporate website, 
and by clicking here. 
Vigilance Plan 
In 2022, CMA CGM Group continued to expand and reinforce the application 
of this law within the Group, across its businesses and in its subsidiaries. 
The progress made in 2022 is evaluated on the basis on the five measures 
required by the law:
01. RISK MAPPING
Risks of serious human rights, health and safety, and environmental violations 
are taken into account each time the Group maps its risks or revises its risk 
map. Each risk map is monitored and updated regularly. Each risk is identified 
by the relevant department, and one or more risk managers are tasked 
 
with implementing corrective action or control plans.
02. ASSESSMENT 
PROCEDURES 
In 2022, for the third consecutive 
year, the Group was awarded 
 
the ECOVADIS "Platinum" medal, 
rewarding its CSR commitment and 
duty of vigilance actions. To maintain 
this status, the Group has obtained 
various international certifications 
 
(ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001), 
accelerated the evaluation of its 
suppliers and strengthened supplier 
risk management through the Group’s 
Accelerate programme.  
03. SUITABLE ACTIONS 
In 2022, several initiatives were 
launched to protect fundamental 
freedoms, fight against all forms of 
discrimination and improve working 
conditions, particularly in the context 
of the Russian-Ukrainian crisis. Strong 
positions have been adopted and 
solutions have been deployed 
to protect the planet and reduce 
 
global warming and the impact on 
biodiversity.
04. WHISTLEBLOWING 
SYSTEM  
All employees and stakeholders of the 
Group are encouraged to report, in 
good faith, any breach of the Code 
of Ethics, using a secure dedicated 
hotline accessible 24/7.
05. MONITORING 
THE IMPLEMENTED 
MEASURES
A set of indicators has been deployed 
to monitor the implementation of all 
measures adopted by the Group. 
These indicators are monitored and 
overseen by the relevant Managements 
and teams.

Acting for the planet
6. Fighting  
climate change 
CMA CGM Group is committed to the energy transition in logistics 
and in maritime, inland and air transport, and has set itself 
 
a Net Zero Carbon target by 2050. CMA CGM’s goal is to become 
 
a leader in carbon-free transport solutions. To achieve this objective, 
the Group’s efforts are based on three decarbonisation levers:
- 
1st decarbonisation lever: state-of-the-art ships, vehicles and aircraft 
to optimise energy consumption;
- 2nd decarbonisation lever: new energies: 
o 
liquefied natural gas, biomethane, synthetic methane, e-methane 
and biodiesel for maritime transport 
o natural gas, biofuels, hydrogen, electricity for inland transport
o the use of low-carbon energy in our warehouses;
- 
3rd decarbonisation lever: Operational excellence on a day-to-day 
basis.  
The Group also invests in research and development (R&D) 
 
to develop the clean solutions of the future.
The Group's  
climate challenges
The Group devotes the necessary resources to implement a genuine 
decarbonisation strategy and, in particular, has set up a cross-functional 
team that brings together the full range of expertise needed to define 
the pathway to be followed.
As a global logistics player, CMA CGM Group provides maritime, 
road, air, barge and rail transport services. Maritime transport is 
 
the mode of transport with the lowest CO2 emissions when calculated 
per tonne transported. However, by volume, it is the principal source 
of the Group’s emissions.

- 1.8 million sqm of photovoltaic panels installed on CEVA Logistics warehouses by 2025
- 95 dual fuel ships by 2026
 OBJECTIVES:
"In 2022, we continued to make progress in adopting new greener 
fuels to power our ships. After having pioneered the use of liquefied 
gas-powered ships in recent years, we ordered 18 new bio-methanol-
powered ships, thus acquiring the opportunity to tap into a diversity 
of low carbon footprint energy sources over the next several decades. 
By 2026-2027, more than 100 CMA CGM ships will be able 
 
to operate on fuels that are over 65% lower in carbon content (biogas 
and biomethanol), and we will continue our work to encourage 
 
the production of these solutions.
In addition to gas and biomethanol and their decarbonised derivatives, 
we are continuing our R&D work with our technical and energy 
suppliers on the compounds of tomorrow, which may include ammonia 
and green hydrogen. At this point in time, no avenue to accelerate 
the decarbonisation of maritime transport can be overlooked. We will 
continue to support research and innovation at all stages, from energy 
production methods to the design of our ships and their operational 
efficiency through digital connectivity."

CMA CGM uses the GHG Protocol Standard, 
a benchmark method developed by the World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD) and the World Resources Institute 
(WRI). The Group applies the protocol to the 
different scopes (1, 2 and 3) and breaks down 
the various categories and subparts of Scope 
3. This standard is also used in the Group’s 
responses to the Carbon Disclosure Project 
(CDP) and ECOVADIS questionnaires. 
The Group also participates in the working group 
launched by the Science-Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi***) to develop sector-based trajectories 
for the maritime sector, which brings together 
several maritime companies.
In addition, the Group is a member of the Smart 
Freight Centre (SFC) and the Clean Cargo Working 
Group (CCWG), which establish additional rules 
and recommendations for reporting on logistics 
and maritime transport activities. CMA CGM 
 
is also a contributor to the working groups tasked 
with defining climate reporting frameworks 
 
by the Smart Freight Centre for freight transport 
and by the Federation of European Private Port 
Operators (FEPORT) for port terminals.
*These data are based on averages by type of transport carried out by the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC), with the exception 
of maritime transport, for which the Group's operational data have been used (GLEC is a working group of the Smart Freight Center 
responsible for defining a harmonised calculation methodology in the transport and logistics sector).

CMA CGM: DECARBONISING 
MARITIME TRANSPORT
In 2022, we continued to make progress in adopting 
new fuels to power our ships. After having pioneered 
the use of liquefied gas-powered ships in recent 
years, we ordered 18new bio-methanol-powered 
ships, thus providing ourselves with a variety of 
low carbon footprint energy sources over the next 
several decades. Although several compounds have 
gained prominence (CH4, CH3OH, H2, NH3), none 
of them yet stands out as the must-have solution for 
decarbonising tomorrow’s transport. We intend to 
continue to support innovation at all stages, from 
energy production to the design of the ships. For this 
reason, CMA CGM has launched a Fund for Energies, 
which will provide financing for solutions to achieve 
the ambitious goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 that 
we have set ourselves.
CEVA LOGISTICS: DECARBONISING 
SHORE-BASED LOGISTICS  
CEVA Logistics is a freight forwarder. Therefore, 
 
the company has few assets and relies on numerous 
carriers to transport its customers’ goods by sea, 
air, road and rail. CEVA Logistics is also an expert 
in contract logistics and operates several hundred 
warehouses, most of which are leased. Despite this 
asset light model, CEVA, as a major company in 
 
the logistics sector, has a responsibility to decarbonise 
its activities, not only by taking actions concerning 
its own assets, but also by encouraging its suppliers 
and subcontractors to invest in the technologies 
 
of tomorrow.

Analysis  
of our CO2 emissions
CMA CGM’S CO2 EMISSIONS FROM MARITIME 
ACTIVITIES
In 2022, CMA CGM’s vessel fleet emitted 30.1 million tonnes of CO2e 
(WTW), a reduction of 460kt of CO2e and of 1.5% compared with 
2021. The optimisation of operations and ships, the "decongestion" 
of ports worldwide and CMA CGM Group’s purchase of over 
 
60,000 tonnes of biofuels (biodiesel) enabled it to reduce WTW 
 
emissions from its maritime activities. At the same time, operational 
performance on a TTW basis improved slightly, from 54g CO2e/TEU-
km in 2021 to 52 in 2022. Taking into account upstream fuel emissions 
 
(WTW), this operational performance also improved by almost 4%, 
falling from 64g CO2e/TEU-km in 2021 to 61.4 in 2022, in particular 
due to the purchase of biofuels and the new LNG vessels that began 
service in 2022.
CEVA LOGISTICS’ CO2 EMISSIONS 
Since 2020, CEVA Logistics has measured the energy consumption 
 
of its warehouses and its own truck fleet, and has improved its reporting. 
In 2022, Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions totalled 93 ktonnes CO2 eq 
 
for its warehouses and 189 ktonnes CO2 eq for its truck fleet. 
In addition, starting this year, CEVA Logistics has calculated its Scope 
3 emissions from subcontracted sea and air transport. These account 
for the majority of CEVA’s direct and indirect emissions and total 
 
3,296 ktonnes CO2 eq.

CMA CGM and ENGIE are jointly investing in the 
first industrial and commercial unit that will produce 
biomethane from solid biomass waste, the so-called 
second generation for the shipping industry.
NEOLINE PROJECT 
#PILLAR 3   
Exploring wind propulsion  
CMA CGM is contributing to the construction of 
the first wind propulsion cargo ship: the Neoliner, 
on which work began in January 2023, and which 
 
is expected to enter into service in 2025 between 
the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North America.
ENERGY OBSERVER PROJECT 2 
#PILLAR 3  
Exploring hydrogen propulsion  
CMA CGM and Energy Observer are working together 
on the development of a liquid hydrogen powered 
container ship dedicated to the CMA CGM group's 
short lines.
The fund is structured on the basis of four priorities 
and the CSR department monitores the 4th pillar.
PILLAR 1: Supporting the development and 
production of renewable energies 
The Fund is intended to accelerate the emergence 
 
of industrial production units for alternative fuels (biodiesel, 
biomethane, e-methane, decarbonatedmethanol, etc.) 
by developing partnerships but also co-investments 
in production units.
2ND PILLAR: Accelerating the decarbonisation of 
port terminals, warehouses and land vehicle fleets
The Group operates warehouses, depots and terminals 
and aims to make them energy self-sufficient through 
the production of low-carbon energy: wind, solar, 
biomass and hydrogen by 2025.
3RD PILLAR: Supporting, testing and launching 
projects at the cutting edge of innovation
CMA CGM is involved in the development of 
projects, prototypes and experiments. In particular, 
the development team is working to optimise 
 
the design and propulsion of large container ships 
to reduce their energy consumption. 
4TH PILLAR: Reducing fuel consumption and increasing 
the energy efficiency of the working methods and 
mobility of CMA CGM Group employees
The energy management plan for the office building 
fleet will reduce consumption through investments 
 
in insulation, automation and energy upgrades. It will 
also diversify the energy mix. CMA CGM encourages 
its employees to use soft mobility.
This new cross-functional and independent business unit, attached to the Assets and Operations 
Department, covers all of the Group's divisions. This structure is supported by a dedicated governance 
and investment committee.
In September 2022, Rodolphe Saadé announced the creation of the Fund for Energies with 
 
a USD 1.5 billion budget over 5 years to accelerate the Group’s energy transition towards 
 
its 2050 Net Zero target. The CMA CGM Fund for Energies invests in the industrial production 
 
of new energies and in low-emission mobility solutions for all the Group's activities: maritime, 
inland and air transport, port and logistics activities, and offices. It is endowed with significant 
financial resources to accelerate the Group's energy transition in all its components.
Rodolphe Saadé,  
Chairman and CEO of CMA CGM Group, stated:
"This Fund will enable us to make significant 
investments in innovative projects in order  
to decarbonise our activities. We are equipping 
ourselves to accelerate our energy transition  
and that of the entire transport and logistics industry."

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
An internal carbon price is a tool that enables 
companies to factor the costs of greenhouse 
gas emissions into their business or investment 
decisions.
For a family-owned group like CMA CGM, which 
is fi
 rmly focused on the long term, adopting 
an internal carbon price was a natural step 
to managing climate change risks and achieving 
our sustainability objectives. 
A dedicated cross-business line committee 
worked in 2022 on the scope and value of 
carbon pricing within CMA CGM, based on 
an analysis of the Group’s emissions and best 
practices in the area. 
As a result, the Group decided to incorporate 
an internal carbon price into our key business 
and investment decisions, in order to direct our 
efforts towards cleaner and more sustainable 
energy. 
INTERNAL CARBON PRICE
A Green Shipping Corridor is a maritime route between 
two ports where all maritime transport operations 
are low or zero carbon. It offers the opportunity 
to accelerate progress towards decarbonising the 
maritime sector through the voluntary and collaborative 
participation of all stakeholders in the value chain: 
ports, terminals, carriers, shippers, energy providers, 
institutions. It also aims to encourage the emergence 
of new business models, business opportunities 
and socio-economic benefi
 ts, while reducing the 
impact of maritime transport on climate change and 
improving air quality. These green corridors are the 
result of the signature of the Clydebank Declaration 
for Green Shipping Corridors at the COP26 in 2021. 
Twenty-four States, including France, Japan, Singapore 
and the United States, committed to establishing 
six maritime green corridors by 2025. 
For example, the Group participates in the Shanghai-
Los Angeles green corridor project that was launched 
by the ports of Los Angeles  and Shanghai and the 
C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. The project 
aims to promote by 2030:
CEVA is a member of the Sustainable Air 
Freight Alliance (SAFA), a collaborative initiative 
including maritime transport, air cargo and 
freight forwarding companies that are committed 
to measuring and reducing their CO2 emissions 
and that advocate responsible transport. 
CEVA has also joined United Airlines’ Eco-Skies 
Alliance, a programme that brings together 
leading global companies that work with the 
airline to achieve more sustainable aviation. 
EXAMPLES OF PARTICIPATION IN SECTORAL INITIATIVES
Involvement in Green Shipping Corridors 
the gradual introduction of ships using low-, ultra-
low and zero-carbon fuels; 
the  development  of  best  management  practices 
to  help  reduce  emissions  and  improve  effi
 ciency 
of  all  ships  using  this corridor; 
the reduction of emissions from port operations, 
in particular through electrifi
 cation;
improved air quality in the ports of Shanghai and 
Los Angeles and adjacent communities.
The Group is also a partner in the initiative between 
the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore and 
the Port Authority of Rotterdam to establish the 
longest green and digital corridor. This will encourage 
low-or zero-carbon shipping between the two ports. 
Other projects involving the Group are also under 
consideration.
04. Decarbonisation of terminals 
-  
Optimising terminal operations using IoT and data 
analysis ("Smart Terminal" project). 
-  
Reducing the GHG emissions of all our terminals 
applying low-carbon energy supply solutions and 
an equipment renewal plan integrating energy 
effi
 cient solutions ("Green Terminal" project).
In connection with this project, CMA CGM conducted 
an energy audit of its terminals and depots. This 
comprehensive assessment served as the basis for 
the decarbonisation roadmap, which takes into account 
the geographical, energy and economic specifi
 cities 
of the various terminals and on-shore depots.
05. Risk analysis
-  
Regular mapping of short- and long-term energy 
transition risks in terms of assets, fuels, regulation, 
trade due to the complexity and cost of implementing 
low-emission technologies, access to low-emission 
fuels, potential speed reduction, increased indirect 
costs due to the integration of the maritime sector 
into carbon quota systems, etc. 
-  
development of a simulation tool for decarbonisation 
scenarios.
International coalition 
for tomorrow’s energies
In 2020, Rodolphe Saadé created an international 
coalition to develop the energies of tomorrow for 
transport and logistics. This coalition aims to increase 
and pool investments to reduce the carbon footprint 
of transport and logistics across the value chain. 
The objective is to promote the use of new energies, 
strengthen R&D in the transport sector and promote 
cross-sector cooperation to determine future CO2
reduction standards. 
The 18-member team is assisted by 100 energy 
transition experts. They studied a number of new topics 
in 2022, including accelerating the electrifi
 cation of 
last-mile delivery and developing e-fuel production 
synergies. 
The coalition is conducting 12 concrete projects 
to accelerate the energy transition for all modes 
of transport. Publications, studies and projects 
launched in 2022 include: 
-  
accelerating the use of hydrogen trucks in European 
corridors; 
-  
zero-emission solutions by deploying shipboard 
carbon capture; 
-  
a life cycle analysis of e-fuels for maritime transport, 
such as green ammonia, hydrogen, e-methanol and 
e-methane, in order to determine the full environmental 
impact based on actual operational data; 
-  
converting port terminals into green hubs, connecting 
them and accelerating intermodal shift to barge 
and rail transport, in partnership with the French 
Maritime Cluster; 
-  
assessing the potential for using 100% Sustainable 
Aviation Fuel (SAF); 
-  
contribution to the methodological work of the Global 
Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) in conjunction 
with the Smart Freight Centre, an international non-
profi
 t organisation that aims to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions from freight transport.

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
CMA CGM operate a network of over 50 terminals 
worldwide with a wide variety of operations and 
equipment, but generally in a sensitive urban 
context. This gives us a dual responsibility, both 
in terms of innovation to be able to support the 
development of a whole range of decarbonised 
port equipment, and to develop our own green and 
decarbonised energy resources in our terminals, 
 
in order to accelerate and better control the time 
frame of our decarbonisation roadmap. This twofold 
challenge has been the guiding principle of our 
actions since 2022 and we will begin an ambitious 
action plan for a dozen priority terminals in 2023. 
Various actions have been undertaken in the terminals 
and depots to reduce their environmental impact: 
photovoltaic panels if the site permits, hybrid handling 
equipment, reduced fuel consumption, supply of 
biodiesel, LED lighting, etc.
TERMINALS, WAREHOUSES AND DEPOTS: DECARBONISATION OF ENERGY 
CMA CGM
The Group has also acquired a stake in 
NEOLINE, a project for a cargo ship using 
wind power for primary propulsion and 
designed for transatlantic routes. NEOLINE 
has chosen to use wind propulsion, but also 
relies on innovative and industrially mature 
technologies that ensure performance and 
flexibility of use. This mode of propulsion, 
combined with a reduction in the operating 
speed to 11 knots, halves the energy required 
to travel one nautical mile. The NEOLINE 
pilot line, which is open to all shippers, will 
offer a tailor-made 265 TEU service between 
the Atlantic coasts of Europe and the United 
States, with service to the archipelago of 
Saint-Pierre & Miquelon. Construction will 
begin in early 2023 and the ship should be 
commissioned in the first half of 2025.

CMA CGM: EVOLUTION OF THE MARITIME FLEET
The Group has undertaken numerous actions to reduce its fuel consumption and therefore its GHG emissions: 
monitoring consumption, renewing its fleet, modifications (retrofits), such as technical improvements 
 
in propulsion, hydrodynamics, aerodynamics (installation of wind deflectors), scrubbers and cold ironing*. 
"The CMA CGM Marco Polo is equipped 
with a new wind deflector installed  
on its bow. This new equipment improves 
the ship’s aerodynamics and should 
reduce fuel consumption by 2%."
- 
Ship orders to diversify and decarbonise the 
energy mix
By 2026, 77 "e-methane ready" ships, with a capacity 
between 2,000 and 23,000 TEU, will be added 
 
to the Group’s fleet. Along with 18 methanol-powered 
vessels, they will diversify the energy mix of the 
 
CMA CGM fleet. 
- An optimised and regularly renewed owned fleet 
CMA CGM has a department tasked with optimising 
the design and propulsion of new ships ordered. 
In order to have a young fleet, the Group has 
 
a regular fleet renewal policy.
- Less CO2 thanks to state-of-the-art ships 
The Group continuously improves the performance 
 
of its own fleet to generate fuel savings and reduce its 
carbon impact. Innovations optimise the hydrodynamics 
and aerodynamics of ships at the speeds at which 
 
they travel: modification of bow bulbs and propellers, 
water flow straightening nozzles installed upstream 
of the propeller, wind deflectors installed on 
 
the foreward casing, etc. When the CO2 gains have 
been confirmed, these optimisations are extended 
to a larger number of vessels, added either from 
 
the design stage or during regular dry-dock maintenance 
operations.
In addition, the Group is constantly on the lookout 
for new technical solutions: disruptive hull designs, 
state-of-the-art aerodynamic superstructures, and 
e-fuel ready engines. All these innovations make it 
possible to exceed International Maritime Organization 
(IMO) criteria, in particular the Energy Efficiency 
Design Index (EEDI) for new ships.
*Cold ironing is the technology that enables ships to be connected to shore power
Decarbonisation of terminals roadmap
The Group has set up a roadmap to decarbonise 
terminals. An initial assessment of energy consumption 
and equipment was carried out. Based on this 
assessment, different scenarios were developed 
for the terminals identified as priorities. Tests are 
underway on the new technologies and equipment 
available in order to determine the best solutions 
 
to be deployed at all sites. Research and development 
in decarbonisation in the sector is still ongoing, and 
the Group is on the lookout for emerging solutions.
A variety of decarbonisation actions have been 
carried out on our sites. Below are some examples: 
- 
At the Los Angeles terminal (FMS terminal), 
 
an experiment of hydrogen-powered container 
handling equipment is underway.
- 
Malta Freeport Terminal has installed over 
 
25,000 sqm of photovoltaic surface: panels on the 
roofs of its buildings, solar car parks, solar bus 
shelters and electric car charging stations. This 
project, which is exemplary in its scale and diversity, 
saves more than 2,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.

ROAD TRANSPORT
To decarbonise the road transport it operates or 
subcontracts, CEVA Logistics relies heavily on technology 
and contributes to the evolution of infrastructures. 
Colis Privé and GEFCO, which joined the Group in 
2022, participate to CEVA Logistics’ road transport 
decarbonisation plan. 
To maintain an efficient fleet, CEVA Logistics chooses 
recent models when renewing equipment, and 
encourages its subcontractors to do the same. Its 
subsidiary, GEFCO has converted its entire fleet of 
long-haul car carriers to the Euro VI standard*, which 
imposes emission limit values for nitrogen oxides 
(NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) 
and particulates.
This year, an ambitious investment plan for electric 
trucks was adopted. The Group is currently operating 
40 electric trucks and vans and the goal is to have 
CMA CGM AIR CARGO: AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE
The Group has acquired the latest generation of 
aircraft: 4 Boeing B777Fs have been ordered and 
two are already flying since June 2022. 4 Airbus 
A350Fs, the most economical aircraft on the market, 
have also been ordered and will join the fleet from 
2025. These planes have the best environmental 
performance in the freight sector, particularly in 
terms of CO2 emissions. 
In addition, CMA CGM has signed a strategic air 
freight partnership agreement with Air France-KLM. 
This commercial partnership will enable the two groups 
to pool their networks and aircraft capacities in order 
to optimise aircraft loading and increase efficiency.
"By investing in the most modern and efficient aircraft,  
by equipping itself with the most advanced flight optimisation 
systems, by supporting the production of sustainable fuels,  
and by partnering with aircraft and engine manufacturers  
to advance innovation in synthetic fuels, CMA CGM Air Cargo  
aims at making an active contribution to the energy transition  
of the air freight industry. "

COLIS PRIVÉ
Colis Privé obtained its first ISO 50001 certification in 2022. This 
certification confirms Colis Privé’s commitment to managing and 
reducing its energy consumption in its buildings, IT and transport. 
This commitment is reflected by its actions to monitor consumption 
and increase the reliability of measurements, as well as its actions 
 
to reduce energy consumption (relamping, alternative parcel distribution 
and delivery solutions, employee awareness, energy efficiency 
 
of company vehicles, etc.).
CEVA LOGISTICS
A plan to green our warehouse portfolio, based on a close cooperation 
with building owners and customers, is being implemented. Criteria 
have been added to our property and procurement policy in order 
 
to take into account : environmental standards certification of 
buildings (HQE, BREEAM, etc.), LED lighting, photovoltaic panels and 
systems for optimising and monitoring energy consumption. In 2022, 
 
CEVA Logistics opened a new warehouse in Bogota, Colombia, equipped 
with the latest technology : it is particularly efficient in terms of energy 
and, therefore, GHG emissions. This 15,000 sqm warehouse is optimised 
for recycling operations, covered with solar panels, and has been coated 
with photocatalytic paint, destroying certain organic compounds and 
pollutants. This site has been awarded the EDGE (Excellence in Design 
for Greater Efficiencies) certification. Photovoltaic panels have also 
been installed on the roofs of our warehouses in Malaysia, the United 
Arab Emirates and Peru and it will continue over the next few years. 
If the installation of photovoltaic panels is not possible, new electricity 
contracts are converted into green electricity contracts (low-carbon energy). 
Also by 2023, all warehouses (excluding GEFCO/Ingram CLS) will be 
equipped with LED lighting systems, thus reducing electricity consumption 
by 20%. In terms of renewable electricity, CEVA Logistics’ ambition is 
 
to cover its total electricity consumption worldwide by 2025 using 
 
electricity from renewable or low-carbon sources, in particular photovoltaic 
systems and green energy supply contracts. Another example is 
 
the deployment of electric versus gas handling equipment, which result 
in drastic reduction in fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
"In 2022, CEVA Logistics continued its path towards decarbonisation: 
we have increased by 30% our surface of photovoltaic panels and 75% 
of the surface of our warehouses is now covered by LED lighting.  
In 2022, we also adopted an ambitious investment plan to acquire 
electric vehicles, which will be deployed in the short and medium term. 
Finally, we have continued to work with our suppliers in order to offer 
an always broader range of low-carbon alternatives to our customers."

Up to -20%
Solution in use  
since 2020, transition 
initiated  
to biomethane, 
synthetic methane  
and e-methane
Several partnerships with LNG suppliers such as TotalEnergies and Shell have made it possible 
to set up LNG supplies as marine fuel in several major ports such as Rotterdam, Marseille  
and Singapore. As the leading LNG bunkering hub in France for maritime transport, Marseille’s 
goal is to serve the entire Mediterranean and southern Europe. 
In 2022, the CMA CGM Symi was the first container ship to be bunkered in China  
via  
a ship-to-ship operation in the port of Shanghai.
Liquefied biomethane (LBG)
Biomethane (CH4) is a renewable gas 
produced from biomass such 
as bio-waste or agricultural waste via 
the biological process of anaerobic 
digestion. CMA CGM has chosen 
to source only biomethane produced 
from waste and residue to avoid negative 
externalities.
Compound identical to natural gas but of renewable origin, that permits using the same vessels  
and infrastructure as LNG.
Technology that meets industry safety standards, mature and ready to use for the existing gas fleet.  
High energy density.
Circular economy through recovering biomass waste and returning carbon and nutrients to the soil.
CMA CGM is working with its partners on scaling up this solution, which is a major challenge,  
and on the associated regulations. Under the REPowerEU Plan, Europe aims to increase biomethane 
production tenfold by 2030, thus supporting the development of this fuel.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
At least -67%
Solution currently  
in use (since 2021), 
and numerous projects 
are underway

CMA CGM and Shell completed the first biomethane bunkering operation in December 2021 
in Rotterdam and the Group has decided to support the production of 42,000 tonnes  
of biomethane between 2020 and 2022. 
CMA-CGM, EveRé, Elengy and TotalEnergies are carrying out a circular economy project  
at the Marseille Maritime Port to recover landfill gas from waste in the Marseille area and reuse 
it as fuel.
CMA CGM has invested in the French company Wage Energy, which produces biomethane 
from landfill gas.
CMA CGM is developing a biomethane production and liquefaction project with TITAN  
(a producer of liquefied biomethane in the Netherlands) to supply 7 LNG ships with 
biomethane.
Liquefied synthetic  
methane
Methane (CH4), a renewable gas 
produced from dry industrial waste (wood, 
straw, cardboard, pallets, Tetra Pak®bricks, 
etc.) heated to high temperature 
(gasification).
Approximately 
-75%.
A solution for  
which projects will  
be operational  
by 2025-2026.
In July 2022, CMA CGM announced that it was co-investing with ENGIE in the Salamandre 
project in Le Havre, which will produce 11,000 tonnes of synthetic methane per year starting 
in 2026. It will be the first outgrowth of the partnership between ENGIE and CMA CGM, which 
aims to produce 200,000 tonnes of synthetic methane and low-carbon e-methane by 2030.
Liquefied e-methane
Methane (CH4), a renewable gas 
produced from low-carbon hydrogen and 
captured CO2.
Compound identical to natural gas but of renewable origin, that permits using the same vessels  
and infrastructure as LNG.
Mature technology ready for use in the existing fleet of gas vessels, developed and available transport  
and distribution infrastructure (use of existing gas network).
Technology that meets industry safety standards. High energy density.
Scaling up this solution, as well as the competition for access to low-carbon hydrogen and CO2 capture 
projects (competition with other uses), are major challenges on which CMA CGM is working with its partners 
and on the associated regulations.

CMA CGM is a partner in the Jupiter 1000 project in Fos-sur-Mer. This demonstrator 
coordinated by GRT Gaz will store renewable electricity as low-carbon hydrogen, then convert 
it into e-methane, using industrial CO2 captured from the flue gases of a nearby facility.
CMA CGM is also developing a partnership with ENGIE for this solution.

CMA CGM has expanded discussions with its suppliers on large-scale industrial projects  
with the aim of securing the production of biomethanol and synthetic methanol generated 
using renewable electricity (or e-methanol).
Liquid hydrogen
Liquefied hydrogen (H2) produced using 
renewable electricity.
No carbon atoms, so no CO2 emissions when burned.
Potential solution for small ships and short distances. 
Supply chain management still faces operational and operability constraints in order to meet industry  
safety standards. The physical characteristics of H2 (liquefaction at -253°C and its low energy density) make  
its operability and use quite complex and create technical obstacles (significant loss of cargo volume).
Its current limited availability, high cost and lack of transport and bunkering infrastructure create issues to be 
resolved that CMA CGM is working on.

CMA CGM is a contributor to the Hy24 hydrogen investment fund, along with many other 
major industrial groups and banks. This fund focuses on scaling up proven hydrogen 
technologies to advance decarbonisation.
Two years ago, CMA CGM joined the Energy Observer, an initiative that explores concrete 
solutions to accelerate the energy transition. They are currently working on the Energy 
Observer 2 project that will create and test a prototype liquid hydrogen-powered container 
ship for use on regional lines.
Liquid ammonia
Liquefied ammonia (NH3) produced from 
hydrogen and nitrogen
No carbon atoms, so no CO2 emissions when burned. However, potential emissions of N2O (a greenhouse  
gas with a warming effect 298 times greater than CO2) and NOx (pollutants).

3rd decarbonisation lever:  
decarbonisation  through optimisation  
and pursuit of excellence in operations
CMA CGM MARITIME BUSINESS
Operational excellence is a key lever for reducing the 
Group’s CO2 emissions. Three Fleet Centres cover 
all time zones and operate continuously. Their job is 
 
to assist ships, to provide them with optimised weather 
information in real time, and to propose the best 
route for their journey taking into account weather 
conditions. They work closely with the Operations 
Department, which is responsible for optimising 
 
the full range of the Group’s operations. 
The captains of CMA CGM’s Fleet Centre are 
involved in the development of new technologies 
and functionalities. These tools are made available to 
captains and officers on board the Group’s ships, for 
example, to help them navigate and make decisions 
in bad weather, provide assistance in crossing piracy 
zones and facilitate arrival in congested ports. 
In 2022, the Fleet Centres worked to optimise the 
carbon footprint of ships’ journeys by maintaining 
a constant speed and reducing waiting time on 
arrival through an "appointment" system at 10 key 
terminals. Obtaining berth day guarantees enabled 
ships to slow down by up to 14 days before arrival 
 
at the next port, thus generating energy savings and 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. . 
At the Fleet Centres, an "Energy Efficiency" 
department has been created to accurately 
identify the most efficient and responsible ship 
operating behaviours. In particular, this department 
focuses on: 
- 
fuel and additives quality to improve engine 
performance; 
- 
deploying the best ships on the best trades, based 
not only on their carrying capacity, but also on their 
energy performance;
- 
initial monitoring of a CO2 budget, coupled with 
the traditional budgetary exercise for the lines. 
  
In line with its asset-right model, CEVA Logistics 
subcontracts a major part of its road transport 
activity. Therefore, CO2 emissions generated are 
indirect. However, this activity is one of CEVA’s core 
businesses and we are taking action to reduce its 
impact. For example, in their responses to invitations 
to tender, subcontractors are asked to describe the 
environmental performance of their fleets and their 
actions to promote sustainable development. 
CEVA Logistics works to optimise flows, and thus 
emissions, using intelligent routing, quantity forecasting 
and capacity modelling software. In this way, 
 
CEVA Logistics contributes to optimising truck loads 
and reducing the number of deliveries. 
Digital technologies are a powerful tool for addressing 
several major challenges in maritime transport 
and logistics and reducing their environmental 
footprint. 
- 
CMA CGM has partnered with the start-up Notilo, 
which was incubated in its ZEBOX incubator. 
 
It uses artificial intelligence to inspect ship hulls 
and improve hydrodynamics.

The Group has also entered into an innovative five-
year partnership with the French National Space 
Studies Centre (CNES) to work on connected and 
intelligent routing and port operations.

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
Regulatory issues
The objective of the European Union’s (EU) 
Green Deal is to achieve carbon neutrality by 
2050. In addition to other regulatory measures, 
the European Green Taxonomy is a first step to 
promoting sustainable investment and financing. 
It establishes a list of economic activities the EU 
deems environmentally sustainable and requires 
companies to report the proportion of their 
turnover, capital expenditure and operating 
expenditure that is aligned with these activities.
The information disclosed will permit a more 
meaningful comparison of companies and will 
encourage public and private investment in 
projects that contribute to the transition to 
 
a sustainable, low-carbon economy. CMA CGM 
Group, which does not issue securities traded on 
a regulated market, will be required to comply 
with the taxonomy starting in financial year 2024. 
Nevertheless, the Group actively follows these 
regulatory developments and is preparing for 
these deadlines by making an initial inventory 
of its activities that come within the scope of 
the climate change mitigation and adaptation 
objectives. 
CMA CGM supports the government’s efforts 
 
to accelerate the climate agenda. It is crucial to 
preserve the sector’s ability to streamline international 
trade by following responsible criteria. 
The Group encourages the adoption of ambitious 
standards, in Europe and worldwide, that will enable 
the maritime and logistics sector to do their share 
in the collective effort to reduce greenhouse gases. 
As an international player, CMA CGM Group backs 
global solutions adopted by the IMO, rather than 
regional solutions, and encourages institutions 
 
to adopt approaches based on objectives rather 
than dictating predefined means.
The energy transition of the maritime sector requires 
assistance, particularly in terms of R&D. The revenues 
generated by regulatory obligations should therefore 
be allocated to decarbonising maritime transport. 
In addition, all stakeholders must be mobilised in 
order to ensure the availability of the necessary 
quantities of low-emission fuels and their distribution 
in the dedicated networks.
The Group supports the revision of the IMO’s 
greenhouse gas targets and its alignment with 
 
the voluntary Net Zero 2050 target. To comply with 
these initial short-term measures, CMA CGM set 
up a programme called "Roadmap 2023-2030". 
 
It is supported by a cross-functional team that brings 
together employees from various departments: 
energy, chartering, operations, lines, R&D, regulatory, 
etc. Its members have been working since 2021 
on assessing the performance of each vessel and 
improving or replacing the least efficient vessels, 
 
in order to ensure compliance with the regulations 
to come in 2023. 
CMA CGM supports the Green Deal objectives 
announced by the European Commission. However, 
the Group is particularly vigilant with respect to the 
proposed provisions of the "Fit for 55" legislative 
package. It must be coherent and compatible with 
 
a future international framework. It is therefore 
important to retain the review clauses that permit 
European measures to be aligned with those of 
the IMO.
GREEN TAXONOMY
Technological neutrality should also be ensured, 
 
as the technical solutions that will enable the maritime 
sector to decarbonise are still at highly variable 
stages of maturity. This will permit stakeholders 
 
to adapt to solutions as they become available. It is 
also important that the laws not penalise pioneering 
companies that have chosen to act quickly and have 
invested in more energy-efficient ships.
The overall coherence of the proposed laws and those 
already in force should be a priority. The interrelated 
nature of these laws is a source of complexity which 
should not become an obstacle to the effort required.
Furthermore, in view of the future obligations that will 
be imposed on the maritime transport industry and 
the associated financial penalties, it is essential to give 
the maritime sector the full panoply of available tools 
and solutions to engineer this transition successfully.
The investments needed to decarbonise the sector 
are huge, and transport operators therefore need 
time and a clear picture of the implementation 
schedule of the various regulations.
It is essential that alternative fuels, which are a key 
decarbonisation lever, and the emissions gains 
associated with their use, be considered on a life 
cycle basis and taken into account in the measures 
adopted. 
In addition, there is a need for the actors of the 
maritime industry to be able to directly claim biogas-
related gains by recognising guarantees of origin 
as a traceability mechanism or proof of compliance 
with regulatory obligations. This recognition is 
not yet formally explicit in texts under discussion 
which should be applicable to maritime transport 
 
(EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime). This lack of clarity should 
be addressed quickly in order to provide certainty 
to investments and accelerate biogas production 
without increasing infrastructure costs.

Acting for the planet
7. Improving air quality  
CMA CGM Group is committed to reducing its CO2 emissions 
and endeavours to reduce pollutant emissions from combustion 
 
of traditional fuels: sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx) 
and fine particles (FPs). Air quality is a major public health issue 
and a priority for seafarers, terminal workers and the inhabitants 
of port cities. After having adopted low-sulphur fuel oil in 
January 2020 in accordance with IMO regulations, CMA CGM 
Group remains committed to a process of constant reduction 
 
of atmospheric pollutant emissions by employing new technologies 
and adapting its energy mix.
- Reducing the sulphur content of fuel oils 
- Developing environmentally friendly modes of propulsion 
- Developing shore power connections for ships
The decarbonisation of the Group’s logistics activity and maritime, inland and air transport also 
reduces the pollution generated by its activities. This process is discussed in the chapter above: 
Fighting global warming.
The carbon-free energies to which the Group is turning to power all its equipment are less emissive: 
liquefied natural gas, biomethane, synthetic methane (e-methane) and biodiesel. Diversifying 
the energy mix also involves revamping the fleet, including acquiring vessels compatible with 
alternative fuels and electric land vehicles. Finally, optimising the design and efficiency of ships 
and steering operational excellence by limiting emissions will also reduce pollution. 
Low-emission fuels  
and flue gas treatment  
on CMA CGM vessels 
The traditional fuel oil CMA CGM purchases has a maximum sulphur 
content of 0.5%, in accordance with the International Convention 
for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) of 
 
the International Maritime Organization (IMO). 
For ship propulsion, CMA CGM is making increasing use of LNG, 
 
the industry’s cutting-edge solution for preserving air quality.. It reduces 
SOx emissions by 99%, NOx emissions by 92% and fine particles (FPs) 
by 91%. The Group thus goes well beyond regulatory requirements.
The Group has chosen hybrid flue gas treatment systems (scrubbers) 
that can be used in a closed loop. This system collects a large part 
of the sulphur, hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide residues, which can 
then be treated in shore-based facilities. 86 vessels are equipped with 
hybrid scrubbers (60 owned and 26 chartered vessels), accounting for 
15% of the fleet. 
ELECTRIFICATION OF MACHINERY  
AND VEHICLES 
The Group is investing in electric handling equipment at terminals 
 
to improve air quality for local residents. 
The Group is also committed to progressively electrifying its fleet 
 
of light vehicles that shuttle between terminals and depots. In addition, 
electrical equipment has been installed at recent terminals and 
terminals under construction, such as Puerto Antioquia in Colombia and 
 
Cai Mep in Vietnam.  
CEVA Logistics is also investing in electric trucks to reduce the emissions 
of its supply chain. The company has conducted several pilot projects 
to electrify its truck fleet in various regions, in Asia, North America and 
Europe. Greater detail is provided in the chapter "Fighting climate 
change".

SHORE POWER CONNECTION SYSTEMS  
FOR CMA CGM VESSELS
By connecting to shore power (also known as "cold ironing"), container 
ships calling at ports can shut down their auxiliary engines, thereby 
greatly reducing sulphur oxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxide 
emissions, thus improving air quality, as well as reducing noise pollution. 
All newly built ships are pre-equipped with shore power connection 
systems so they will be ready and able to connect to shore power when 
ports are equipped.
To be able to connect to shore power, a vessel must be "adapted" 
(retrofits to the vessel to install a connection) and "equipped" with 
mobile connection equipment (a container or cable reel to make 
 
the connection). 
A vessel can be considered compatible with shore power connection 
only if it is adapted and equipped. 
CMA CGM is working to retrofit its ships so they can be equipped and 
thus connect to shore power in ports where this is possible. 
Between 2013 and 2022, 66 owned vessels were adapted for shore 
power connection (either retrofitted or original equipment) and 56% 
of vessels are fully equipped. CMA CGM has 66 mobile connection 
facilities. The aim is to equip all ships that are already adapted. 
 
In order to cover maintenance periods, transfers between vessels and 
availability in certain ports, the number of mobile equipment must 
exceed the number of adapted vessels.
CMA CGM vessels are already connecting to shore power in California, 
in accordance with local law, and on a voluntary basis in various ports 
that offer this service, mainly in China and Europe. For example, 
 
in 2022, CMA CGM and Shanghai International Port (SIGP) signed 
 
a collaboration agreement to accelerate the use of shore power.
REGULATORY ISSUES
On 16 December 2022, the 79th session of the Marine Environment 
Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organisation 
(IMO) confirmed to create an Emission Control Area for Sulphur Oxides 
and Particulate Matter (SECA) in the Mediterranean Sea which will be 
applicable from 2025. The creation of this area means that all ships 
entering the Mediterranean will be required to use fuel with a sulphur 
content of no more than 0.1%.
Regarding flue gas treatment systems (scrubbers), local authorities 
may adopt specific requirements that require the use of closed loop 
systems only. CMA CGM closely follows changes in local requirements 
to ensure its fleet remains in compliance. In addition, all vessels check 
local requirements with local officials before berthing or entering 
territorial waters, inland waters and estuaries.

Measuring our impacts
COMMITMENT TO A SUSTAINABLE OCEAN WITH THE UNITED NATIONS
CMA CGM has been a member of the UN Global Compact since 2019 and signed up to the Sustainable 
Ocean Principles at the UN Ocean Conference in Lisbon in June 2022. The Group contributes to deploying 
and promoting these principles through a dedicated working group (Ocean Stewardship Coalition). 
GREEN MARINE EUROPE CERTIFICATION
In order to measure and reduce the environmental impact of its activities 
against a unifying benchmark framework, CMA CGM received Green 
Marine Europe certification in June 2022. This environmental certification 
for the maritime industry is a voluntary initiative of Surfrider Foundation 
Europe. It provides maritime transport companies with a detailed 
framework for measuring and reducing their environmental footprint 
on the basis of eight indicators: underwater noise, NOx air emissions, 
SOx and PM air emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, invasive species, 
waste management, responsible ship recycling and oily discharges.
CMA CGM Group publishes its results and also participates in working 
groups that focus on amendments to the indicators. 
CMA CGM’s commitment to this approach is in line with its signature of 
the SAILS (Sustainable Actions for Innovative and Low-impact Shipping) 
Charter initiated by the French Ministry for the Ecological Transition.
Reducing our impacts  
PREVENTING ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES
To prevent accidental discharges at sea and, in particular, oil pollution 
from the Group’s ships or terminals, CMA CGM deploys rigorous 
measures: fleet maintenance, regular simulations and exercises, 
 
and an emergency management process. 
In addition, 62 vessels in our fleet are equipped with a Fast Oil Recovery 
System (FORS). In the event of a grounding or collision, this system 
enables oil to be pumped out quickly and prevents pollution.
In a spirit of transparency and continuous improvement, 
 
the Group shares its contributions in relation to the 9 principles 
for sustainable use of the oceans. These are indicated by

TREATING BALLAST WATER 
WITHOUT CAUSING POLLUTION 
Ballast tanks are essential for optimising navigation 
and balancing ships. To keep the ocean free of 
microorganisms, our ships’ ballast water is sterilised 
by UV radiation. Banning the use of all chemical 
additives avoids negative impacts on local biodiversity.
PREVENTING TRAFFICKING  
IN PROTECTED SPECIES
The illegal wildlife trade is a thriving business that 
is orchestrated by transnational organised crime 
groups and that takes advantage of international 
trade routes. It poses a major threat to biodiversity, 
the safety of transport chains and the international 
health situation.
Since 2020, CMA CGM Group has reinforced its 
procedures for the maritime transport of protected 
species, whose trade is regulated by the Convention 
on International Trade in Endangered Species 
of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In the event of 
 
a suspicious animal or plant commodity, CMA CGM 
requires the customer to expressly declare whether 
the species is covered by CITES and, if so, to provide 
the required export permit. Preventive measures may 
include suspension of certain exports, such as timber 
from Gambia, which contributes to deforestation in 
West Africa.  
Since 2022, CMA CGM has collaborated with 
 
the University of Adelaide in Australia and supports 
research to:
- 
identify the international shipping routes most 
 
at risk for wildlife trafficking; 
- 
improve biodiversity monitoring and protection 
in the Asia-Pacific region and Oceania 
To achieve these goals, both partners use innovative 
techniques, such as:  
- 
artificial intelligence software to detect suspicious 
containers; 
- 
a pilot project for non-invasive screening of the 
types of species transported, for example using air 
sampling equipment.
Since 2020, the CMA CGM Academy has provided all 
sales agents, including all new hires, with training on 
the illegal transport of protected species, designed 
in conjunction with CITES and the United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). 
Last year, CMA CGM entered into a two-year partnership 
with WWF France. In particular, both partners are 
working to develop internal tools and procedures 
to combat the illegal trade in endangered wildlife 
species. This action is in line with efforts to raise 
awareness of this issue and existing solutions among 
stakeholders and in the maritime transport industry.
INTEGRATING LOGISTICS SITES 
INTO THEIR ENVIRONMENT
Integrating logistics sites into their natural environment, 
in particular to reduce their impact in terms of surface 
sealing and visual nuisances presents a major challenge.
Consistently with CEVA Logistics’ real estate policy, 
for all new projects, building selection criteria take 
into account environmental certifications, such 
as High Environmental Quality (HQE), Building 
Research Establishment Environmental Assessment 
Method (BREEAM) and Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design (LEED). These certifications 
include landscape integration aspects.
A trial was also launched at our Doncaster site in the 
United Kingdom to create flowering meadows around 
this warehouse. A large variety of insect species was 
observed in the meadows and the feedback from 
employees has been extremely positive. This initiative 
will be repeated and expanded in the future.  
Protecting ecosystems
DETECTING MARINE MAMMALS 
[SUSTAINABLE OCEAN PRINCIPLES]
In partnership with the Woods Hole Oceanographic 
Institution (WHOI), in 2022, CMA CGM financed 
 
the installation of two passive acoustic whale 
monitoring hydrophone buoys on the east coast 
of the United States. Detecting whales, especially 
right whales, helps protect one of America’s most 
critically endangered species during its migration. 
 
COMMUNICATING  
THE POSITION OF MARINE 
MAMMALS IN REAL TIME  
CMA CGM uses REPCET, a collaborative system 
 
to track the position of marine mammals in real time. 
The Group will soon roll out a training programme 
to optimise the use of the system and help seafarers 
recognise the different types of marine mammals. 
WHALE SAFE TOOL  
[SUSTAINABLE OCEAN PRINCIPLES]
In partnership with the Marine Mammal Centre 
 
and the Benioff Ocean Initiative, an institute based 
at the University of California Santa Barbara, 
 
CMA CGM’s Fleet Navigation Centre has been using 
since 2011 the Whale Safe tool, which detects whales 
and models their habitats. It automatically alerts 
our ships in due time and permits slowdowns to be 
scheduled when planning trips.  
SLOWING DOWN TO PROTECT 
MARINE MAMMALS  
[SUSTAINABLE OCEAN PRINCIPLES]
In marine mammal breeding areas off the east coast 
of the United States and Canada, CMA CGM vessels 
are required to reduce their speed to a maximum of 
10 knots to prevent the risk of collision. On the west 
coast, near the Santa Barbara Islands, CMA CGM 
has made a voluntary commitment to the Green 
Flag speed reduction programme. 
Furthermore, with the help of the CMA CGM Fleet 
Navigation Centre, whenever possible, the Group 
endeavours to reduce the speeds of its ships to reduce 
the risk of collision in marine mammal sanctuaries. 
 
The Northern Sea Route (NSR), which runs 
along the coast of Siberia and links Asia 
 
to Europe, is now navigable due to the 
effects of climate change. However, the rich, 
unique and largely unexplored biodiversity of 
 
the Arctic plays an essential role in regulating 
ocean currents and the global climate. 
 
To preserve this fragile environment, and 
despite the major competitive advantage 
 
it would offer CMA CGM, no Group vessel 
 
has used this route since 2019. 
PROTECTING THE ARCTIC  
BY REFUSING TO USE THE NORTHERN ROUTE
REDOUBLING OUR EFFORTS TO 
ACHIEVE ZERO LOST CONTAINERS
Every year around the world, containers are lost 
at sea due to difficult sailing conditions or rare 
incidents. In 2022, one of our container ships, APL 
VANDA, encountered an extreme weather event and 
lost 69 containers. We regret this accident and have 
increased our vigilance. We continue to deploy best 
practices to avoid future losses: weather watches, fleet 
navigation centres, weather routing and on-board 
container security systems. We have made "zero loss" 
of containers one of our priority objectives. Finally, 
we also participate in discussions with professional 
associations, such as Armateurs de France, and 
with the competent authorities to further reduce, 
collectively, the risk of losing containers at sea.

known as the Northern Route. The aim of this project 
is to map the areas where whales feed, breed, 
 
give birth and nurse their young - the famous migration 
superhighways called "blue corridors". 
SUPPORTING OYSTER FARMING  
IN THE CHESAPEAKE BAY
CMA CGM partners with the Chesapeake Bay 
Foundation to raise 5.5 million juvenile oysters in 
order to preserve the water quality and biodiversity 
of the region. The Group is a member of Chesapeake 
Oyster Alliance, which aims to raise 10 billion new 
oysters by 2025.
The Chesapeake Bay in the north-eastern United 
States is the largest estuary in the United States. 
Oysters are essential to the ecosystem of the bay. 
They act as a natural filter by removing algae and 
provide habitats for crabs and fish.
RESTORING CORAL REEFS 
[SUSTAINABLE OCEAN PRINCIPLES]
Since 2020, CMA CGM Group’s commitment to healthy 
oceans has been reflected, in particular, through its 
Reef Recovery programme to restore coral reefs. 
These reefs are home to 25% of marine biodiversity 
and make up 0.2% of the ocean surface area. 
 
This programme has created several coral nurseries 
in four regions of the world:
- 
in Australia along the Great Barrier Reef, in conjunction 
with Reef Restoration Foundation (RRF); 
- 
in Florida, in the Molasses Reef off Key Largo, one 
of the most famous scuba diving sites in the United 
States, in conjunction with Reef Renewal Foundation 
International (RRFI);
- 
in the Philippines and Malaysia, in the Coral 
Triangle, in conjunction with Endangered Species 
International;
- 
in the Seychelles, in conjunction with Nature 
Seychelles.
Thanks to the expertise of the partner NGOs, 
 
the nurseries quickly produce mature corals that are 
then transplanted to the natural coral reefs.
In Australia, the Group, via its subsidiary ANL, received 
the support of six of its customers (Coles Supermarkets, 
Costa Group, Kalgin Logistics, Gilmac, Gori and 
Mondiale VGL) and has continued its collaboration 
with RRF to launch a second nursery in Moore Reef.
This coral restoration work is expected to continue 
in other parts of the world, including Costa Rica.
"ACTION FOR FORESTS" 
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FRENCH 
NATIONAL FORESTRY AGENCY 
(ONF)  
In response to the forest fires in the summer of 
2022, the Group renewed its support for the ONF. 
 
CMA CGM, which had sponsored the ONF’s "Respir" 
fund in 2021, pledged €3 million over the next three 
years to the ONF’s "Action for Forests" fund. These 
donations will support the restoration of burnt forests, 
the development of innovative solutions, and studies 
and mechanisms for raising awareness and preventing 
the risk of forest fires throughout France. 
RESTORING AND INFORMING 
ABOUT THE CALANQUES 
NATIONAL PARK
The multi-year sponsorship partnership between 
CMA CGM Group and Calanques National Park, 
which was initiated in 2020, was renewed for two 
years in 2022. The first phase of the partnership 
aimed to enhance the heritage of the Calanques 
area by providing the public with comprehensive 
information about its biodiversity. In this second 
phase, the partnership is being extended to the 
rehabilitation of the Callelongue semaphore station, 
which will then be opened to the public. 
In 2022, CMA CGM employees also took part in 
 
a large-scale clean-up operation in the Calanques 
for World Cleanup Day. 
OFFSETTING IMPACTS  
THROUGH REFORESTATION 
In Vietnam, GEMALINK Terminal launched the 
"SeedtoShip" mangrove reforestation project with 
other industrial players. In late 2022, two hectares of 
mangroves and forests were planted in the Mekong 
Delta with the partner NGO "Manglub Vietnam". This 
project is part of a broader climate and biodiversity 
offsetting initiative.
In Senegal, CMA CGM employees participated in a 
mangrove planting project with the NGO Nebeday. 
Due to a flood, only 15,000 of the 30,000 trees could 
be planted. The remaining 15,000 trees will be 
planted by the NGO. The Group’s employees fully 
supported this project and gained awareness of the 
importance of the mangrove ecosystem in Senegal.
RESTORING FORESTS IN BRAZIL 
WITH THE SOS MATA ATLÂNTICA 
FOUNDATION  
AND CEVA LOGISTICS

Acting for the planet
9. Promoting  
a circular economy
In 2022, CMA CGM Group made a significant commitment: stopping 
the maritime transport of plastic waste. By doing so, CMA CGM 
takes another step to combat plastic pollution. The Group seeks 
to contribute to the development of a circular economy within 
 
the maritime transport and logistics industries. To this end, 
it offers its customers dedicated services and products. In its 
maritime and shore-based activities, CMA CGM is committed to 
using resources wisely and to reducing packaging and waste from 
its operations. Finally, the CMA CGM Group supports concrete 
actions to combat plastic waste.
- Managing the end of life of the Group’s physical assets more responsibly
- Reducing waste and contributing to the development of treatment facilities
- Partnering with different actors to find innovative solutions
Stopping the transport of plastic waste  
(plastic scrap ban)
At the 2022 One Ocean Summit, the Group announced that it would cease to transport plastic waste on 
board its ships as of 1 June 2022. With this pioneering move in the maritime transport industry, CMA CGM 
will no longer transport plastic waste to destinations where it cannot be sorted, recycled or recovered. 
Through this commitment, the Group reaffirms its intent to contribute to the protection of the oceans and 
biodiversity, and to develop economic exchanges that are more respectful of the integrity of all persons 
and of the planet. 
Providing support  
to customers  
To reduce its environmental impact and lead the maritime transport 
and logistics industries towards more environmentally friendly practices, 
CMA CGM offers a range of services focused on the environmental 
impact of cargoes. 
OPTIMISING PACKAGING
CEVA Logistics helps its customers to reduce and optimise their 
packaging. For example, CEVA Logistics offers to reutilise used cardboard 
packaging in wedging systems through the use of shredders, and 
 
to compact packaging waste in order to reduce its volume and optimise 
its shipment to recycling centres. 
In the automotive sector, CEVA Logistics offers tailor-made reusable 
packaging for the transport of spare parts to factories. In collaboration 
with its customers, CEVA Logistics also provides solutions to reduce 
the size of packaging (customised packaging systems) and optimise 
container loads.  
RECYCLING PACKAGING
This year, the Group launched a new collection service for recycling 
used shipping packaging in Indonesia: Easy Recycling. Customers 
 
who use Easy Recycling unpack their cargo and leave their used 
packaging in return containers bound for the CMA CGM depot in 
Cakung. At the depot, used paper and plastic packaging is collected 
and sorted for recycling. CMA CGM plans to extend this service 
 
to other countries. With Easy Recycling, CMA CGM is helping 
 
to establish a circular economy and preserve biodiversity by preventing 
packaging waste from ending up in waterways.

Reducing the impacts of packaging  
and waste on resources
GREEN SHIP: THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROGRAMME FOR SHIPS
CMA CGM is deploying an exemplary environmental 
programme called Green Ship on all its owned vessels. 
This programme goes beyond the requirements 
of the MARPOL international convention for the 
prevention of marine pollution from ships. In particular, 
ships monitor, update and report the quantities of 
waste generated, and shipboard personnel receive 
specific training. 
TREATMENT AND REUSE  
OF WASTEWATER  
FROM SHORE-BASED SITES
The Group has depots in various countries around 
the world, which are subject to specific regulations 
in each region. The Group endeavours to reduce 
the impacts of its shore-based activities.
Nine CMA CGM depots are equipped with wastewater 
treatment systems. In six of them, the treated water 
is reused to wash containers and irrigate green 
spaces, thus reducing the sites’ water consumption 
and their impact on biodiversity. Five other depots 
are currently developing water treatment systems. 
The Group’s terminals are also progressively being 
equipped with wastewater treatment systems, 
for example:
- 
Kaoshiung Terminal in Taiwan has a wastewater 
treatment facility that treats water used to wash 
empty containers before it is discharged; 
- 
the TMT Alexandria Terminal in Egypt is also studying 
the installation of a wastewater treatment unit with 
the aim of recycling wastewater for use in washing 
areas and to irrigate green spaces. 
SAVING WATER:  
REUSING RAINWATER
CEVA Logistics, although not a significant consumer 
of water resources, is studying ways to reduce water 
use. Some systems are proven and functional, such as 
rainwater harvesters. These are in use at the Ontigola 
site in Spain and the Jundiai site in Brazil. Other 
projects are under consideration, such as domestic 
water conservation measures.
COLLECTION OF PAINT CANS  
FOR RECYCLING 
At all depots in France (CCIS France), used paint 
cans are recycled via a specialised recycling channel. 
SHIP DISMANTLING
The end-of-life of ships is a major challenge for 
the maritime transport industry given existing 
dismantling practices and the materials used in 
 
the construction of ships. Pending ratification of 
the Hong Kong International Convention for the 
Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships, 
 
since 2008, the Group has inventoried hazardous 
materials on board its owned ships. 
When a ship must be decommissioned, the Group 
chooses dismantling yards that are systematically 
audited and that comply with international and 
local health, safety and environmental standards. 
 
A set of requirements governs these operations, 
 
such as conducting cutting operations on impermeable 
surfaces and storage of hazardous waste. 
No ship in the Group’s fleet were decommissioned 
in 2021 and 2022. 
OIL SLUDGES
Before being used, the fuel oil from our ships must 
be centrifuged in separators located in the engine. 
This process generates residues: hydrocarbon 
sludge composed of 75% water and fuel oil, as well 
as particles that are approximately 25% unsuitable 
for machine combustion. The sludge is unloaded 
on land and taken in charge for reprocessing by 
land-based channels. A specific team at CMA CGM 
headquarters is in charge of monitoring the unloading 
of these sludges and relations with the partners in 
charge of unloading and treatment.
Partnership to tackle plastic waste 
PLASTIC ODYSSEY PROMOTES 
RECYCLING OF PLASTIC WASTE
This year, the Group partnered with Plastic Odyssey. 
This association works to reduce plastic pollution in 
the oceans through a global network of low-tech and 
low-cost local initiatives and technologies specialised 
in plastic waste recycling and reclaiming. 
In 2022, Plastic Odyssey launched a three-year 
expedition. The ship will call in the 30 countries most 
affected by plastic pollution, on three continents, 
South America, Africa and Asia, and will meet local 
entrepreneurs. Some ten technologies were installed 
on board the ship to demonstrate how to collect, 
sort, crush, melt and decompose plastic and then 
reuse it as fuel or in other recycled objects. 
In each country, the ship will also serve as a laboratory 
for technological innovations developed by start-ups: 
water purification, cogeneration, etc. 
PLASTIC FLAMINGO, A NEW 
PLASTIC BAG RECYCLING LINE 
Plastic Flamingo is a Manila-based social enterprise 
that combats marine plastic pollution. It collects and 
recycles plastic waste before it can reach the oceans.
In 2022, with the support of CMA CGM Group, Plastic 
Flamingo inaugurated a new recycling line at the 
Muntinlupa recycling plant dedicated to single-use 
plastic bags. These are one of the most significant 
sources of pollution in the Philippines and accumulate 
in the streets, sewers and, eventually, in the rivers 
and oceans. 
The goal of the partnership between CMA CGM and 
Plastic Flamingo is to collect 120 tonnes of plastic 
waste in one year in the Greater Manila area and 
 
to recycle it. This partnership also raises awareness 
of the dangers of marine plastic pollution. Finally, 
this project has created 12 full-time jobs.

courses. In particular, the Group carries out targeted programmes 
on combating bribery and influence peddling, compliance with 
the competition laws, compliance with economic sanctions, data 
management, preventing illicit trafficking and tax transparency. 
 
"2022 was a year rich in compliance challenges, especially due 
to the massive expansion of economic sanctions. CMA CGM 
successfully met these challenges with a compliance program  
that is integrated into all our transactions, from bookings to 
strategic M&A transactions. This program will be enhanced in 2023 
with a new platform dedicated to ethics and compliance that will 
reinforce these topics for all our employees."

*The Ethics & Compliance Helpline is available on here.
Preventing bribery and influence peddling
CMA CGM continues to strengthen and deploy 
its programme to prevent, detect and combat 
bribery and influence peddling. This incorporates, 
in particular, the requirements of applicable laws, 
such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), 
 
the United Kingdom Bribery Act (UKBA) and the 
French Sapin II Act. 
The Anti-Bribery Code of Conduct set out the rules 
applicable to the prevention of bribery and influence 
peddling and the disciplinary sanctions applicable 
in the event of breach.
The anti-bribery and anti-influence peddling 
programme covers, in particular, the following 
matters:
- 
the commitment of the governing body and regular 
monitoring by the Risk, Compliance, Audit and 
Inspection Committee and the Audit and Accounts 
Committee
- 
verification of the proper implementation of 
 
the Anti-Bribery Code of Conduct; 
- 
promotion of the Ethics & Compliance Helpline 
whistleblowing report system;
- 
the updated mapping of integrity risks, in particular 
within the scope of the Group’s new activities; 
Preventing illicit trafficking
The Group constantly reinforces the resources 
 
it devotes to combating illicit trafficking, whether 
 
in drugs, weapons, protected species or counterfeit 
goods. In 2022, CMA CGM further strengthened 
its prevention capabilities, both onboard container 
ships and through the various vectors involved 
 
in the Group’s logistics activities. 
Regular meetings with the customs authorities 
 
of the countries in which the Group operates are 
key steps in strengthening cooperation and fighting 
illicit trafficking more effectively.
New tools and procedures are constantly being 
developed, and the Group cooperates fully with 
 
the competent authorities in France and internationally. 
For example, in Indonesia, in order to combat illicit 
trafficking, in 2022, the Group met with customs and 
port authorities and representatives of the Jakarta 
International Container Terminal (JICT), the largest 
terminal in Indonesia. CMA CGM reaffirmed its 
commitment to combat all forms of illicit trafficking, 
including in drugs, weapons, protected species and 
counterfeit goods.
To support its commitments, the Group is a member 
of the Baltic and International Maritime Council 
(BIMCO). This association facilitates the business 
operations of its members by drafting standardised 
contracts and contractual clauses. 
CMA CGM’s Central Security Department also 
coordinates a working group within the World Shipping 
Council (WSC), the Custom Interface Working Group. 
It aims to be the voice of the maritime transport 
industry with respect to preventing illicit trafficking 
vis-à-vis policy makers and other industry groups 
with an interest in international transport. 
In 2022, 245 whistleblowing reports were processed 
and closed out of 320 received:
- 28% of whistleblowing reports concerned CMA CGM
- 
72% of whistleblowing reports concerned CEVA 
Logistics.
In 2022, no significant violations concerning bribery, 
internal fraud, discrimination, child labour or forced 
labour were reported through the whistleblowing 
system.  
- 
the identification, assessment, prioritisation and 
management of risk control plans and communicating 
them to top management and relevant staff; 
- 
a compliance assessment of CMA CGM’s most 
high-risk partners, intermediaries, suppliers and 
customers; 
- 
the implementation of anti-bribery and anti-influence 
peddling accounting controls; 
- training programmes; 
- external audits of the anti-bribery compliance system. 
The Group participates in joint actions with other 
players in the maritime industry. CMA CGM is 
 
a member of the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network 
(MACN), which shares tools and experience on 
 
the implementation of anti-bribery programmes 
 
in the maritime and port sector. 
GEFCO launched a campaign to have the most 
exposed employees sign letters certifying the absence 
of conflicts of interest. This letter must be signed on 
hiring and, thereafter, every 18 months. The aim of 
this preventive action is to make employees more

Compliance with economic sanctions
Responsible data management
CMA CGM Group conducts all its activities in 
compliance with the laws on economic sanctions 
and embargoes applicable to it. The compliance 
programme includes a set of dedicated policies 
and procedures to economic sanctions and which 
apply to all employees. CMA CGM Group’s approach 
 
in this area positions it as a partner of national and 
international authorities.
Compliance with international sanctions is ensured 
by systematic application of controls at each 
stage of transactions. This includes analysing 
 
the following factors:  
- The goods the Group transports;   
- 
The entities with which the Group interacts, including 
its suppliers; 
- 
The containers used for countries subject to US 
sanctions;   
- The itinerary of the ships;  
- Appropriate payment procedures. 
The most critical transactions are blocked automatically, 
whereas the most sensitive transactions are detected 
and reviewed using three main "lines of defence": 
operational staff, then specialised teams at the 
head office and, finally, internal audit, which has 
integrated the risks of economic sanctions into its 
regular assignments. Finally, the Group is committed 
to training its employees on this issue and informing 
them of developments in real time, including through 
specific training and information memos sent to the 
most exposed staff. In 2022, 74.24% of employees 
completed the e-learning course on compliance with 
economic sanctions.  
Due to the expansion of sanctions against Russia 
and Belarus, the economic sanctions compliance 
programme has been strengthened through a variety 
of measures:  
- 
new and continuously improved controls and 
freezes (including automatic ones) of all transactions 
 
to comply with the various sanctions packages; 
- 
the integration of an additional tool for in-depth 
analysis of the capital structures of high-risk 
customers and partners;
- 
supporting the Group’s growth through continuous 
dialogue with the relevant authorities, including 
on sensitive acquisitions from entities exposed to 
applicable sanctions.
DATA SECURITY/CYBERSECURITY
As a leading international shipping and logistics 
company, cybersecurity is a key issue for CMA CGM 
Group in terms of growth and trust. 
Therefore, CMA CGM Group continues to strengthen 
and deploy its data and asset protection strategy 
(protection of information assets). This combines 
both technological investments, in order to equip 
ourselves with effective solutions, as well as human 
investments, in order to develop awareness and 
 
a cybersecurity culture within CMA CGM Group. 
In particular, this strategy is based on:  
- 
The incorporation of cybersecurity into the company’s 
governance, with strong management involvement 
and commitment.
- 
The design and deployment of effective cybersecurity 
policies, measures and technologies against 
malicious actors, covering the Group’s physical 
and logical assets, in order to ensure the continuity 
 
of operations and business, as well as the security 
 
of the company and of our employees and customers.
-
 
The dissemination of a cybersecurity culture within 
the company, using tools such as training and 
awareness campaigns for employees.
PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION
For many years, CMA CGM Group has been committed 
to a personal data protection policy covering 
its information systems and its subcontractors. 
 
CMA CGM implements organisational and technical 
means for its customers, suppliers, employees and 
third parties, and extends its compliance policy 
to subcontractors and subsidiaries, to ensure that 
European personal data protection standards are 
observed throughout the world.
On average, the Group takes 11 days to respond to 
an individual’s request for deletion of personal data.
Compliance with competition  
and antitrust laws
Awareness of and compliance with competition law are 
top priorities that CMA CGM sets for its employees. 
The competition law compliance programme applies 
 
to all of the Group’s operations worldwide. It focuses on 
six main principles: maintaining independent business 
strategies, avoiding anti-competitive agreements, 
avoiding customer allocation, avoiding abuses 
 
of dominant position, avoiding unfair competition 
and withdrawing from questionable discussions. 
 
The concrete achievements of this programme ensure 
a healthy and fair economic environment for all. 
This programme is implemented by a team of 
dedicated in-house lawyers, with the assistance 
of local relays. The teams are also available to all 
employees to ensure that all business practices are 
carried out in compliance with the competition law. 
Finally, training on competition and antitrust law 
 
is provided worldwide, both online and in person. 
 
In 2022, 88% of employees completed the mandatory 
"Competition Law" training. 
- 
The development of a true global ecosystem of 
collaboration focused on cybersecurity issues through 
exchanges with other private actors and interaction 
with national and international communities, 
 
as well as with government institutions. CMA CGM 
Group is a member of the Cyber Campus in France.
Tax transparency
CMA CGM Group complies with applicable tax laws 
and pays the taxes due in each country or region 
where the Group does business, in accordance with 
the rules of law and international tax conventions. 
CMA CGM is committed to building a lasting and 
professional relationship with the tax authorities of 
the various countries, in particular by respecting their 
procedures. Due to the complexity of the tax rules, 
differences in interpretation between the Group and 
local tax authorities may arise. In such case, the Group 
reserves the right to dispute any tax adjustments 
 
it considers unfounded. 
The Group applies the OECD transfer pricing standards 
and the principles of the national laws based thereon. 
Tax risk management is an integral part of the Group’s 
overall risk management process. The Group adopts 
a responsible approach to tax management and 
audits, based on documentation and internal control 
reports of tax processes. 
Finally, the Group does not encourage or promote 
tax evasion, either by it or by its subsidiaries. Group 
companies located in non-cooperative states and 
territories are established there solely for business 
or operational reasons.

LISTENING TO CUSTOMERS 
Each year, CMA CGM conducts a global survey of 
its customers. This enables the Group to monitor 
 
its Net Promoter Score*, a benchmark indicator on 
the likelihood that respondents would recommend 
it, and to identify key areas for improvement. 
 
In 2022, the questionnaire was sent to over 430,000 
respondents and CMA CGM received a positive NPS.
In parallel to this survey, the Customer Satisfaction 
survey, which was initiated in 2019, was conducted 
once again this year and will be continued in 2023. 
 
It consists of two questions asked of each person 
who has been in contact with the customer service. 
260,000 questionnaires were sent out and 13,000 
responses were received. Finally, in 2022, in addition 
 
to specific training to improve the customer experience, 
a Customer Journey Mapping initiative was rolled out 
in our network of agencies. This effective and visual 
tool captures what customers experience when they 
interact with our organisation and will help improve 
the quality of the products and services we offer.
CEVA LOGISTICS
Like CMA CGM, CEVA Logistics conducts an annual 
Net Promoter Score survey to help determine 
 
the main areas in which it can improve. 
This year, 35,000 satisfaction questionnaires were 
sent out to customers who had contacted customer 
service, and 10% of them answered the question 
 
"How would you rate your experience with our 
teams?". This enabled CEVA Logistics to immediately 
act on the feedback received and to get back to its 
customers and implement concrete actions to meet 
their needs. 
CEVA Logistics also has a range of tools enabling it 
 
to listen and respond to the needs of its customers on 
a day-to-day basis. For example, the digital solutions 
of the MyCeva virtual assistant help improve the 
level of service and listening provided to customers. 
CMA CGM+: AN OFFER  
OF VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS  
AND SERVICES  
CMA CGM+ offers over 45 value-added products 
and services that complement the shipping and 
logistics offerings.
They fall into five categories.

office is dedicated to the relationship with the Group’s 
customers, to assisting them and to handling their 
questions on the three strategic priorities: People, 
the Planet, Fair Trade. It works closely with the sales 
network and CSR experts. 
In particular, the teams answer customers’ questions, 
share and explain the Group’s CSR strategy, and initiate 
collaborative projects. These services also produce 
the customised CO2 reports for key customers, 
 
and the CO2 ratings included in tenders. 
*This indicator measures customer satisfaction by assessing the likelihood that a customer will or will not recommend a company. 
Possible scores range from -100 (the respondents will not recommend your company) to +100 (the respondents are promoters and will 
recommend your company).

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
Measuring carbon impact
The Group develops software that enables its 
customers to obtain accurate information on their 
carbon emissions. CEVA Logistics and CMA CGM 
 
are active members of Clean Cargo*, a multi-
stakeholder initiative to reduce the environmental 
impact of maritime transport. 
CARBON EMISSION ANALYSES  
FOR CMA-CGM CUSTOMERS 
Information on CO2 emissions is available throughout 
the customer experience. These emissions are 
calculated using the Clean Cargo method. 
Before making a shipment, customers can access 
the Eco-calculator on the eBusiness integrated 
management platform. The carbon footprint is also 
available to customers in the route search engine and 
in the online price quotation tool. In addition, during 
tenders, CMA CGM informs potential customers of 
the carbon footprint of each maritime route for which 
a commercial bid is submitted.
After shipments, the Group provides its customers 
with an analysis of the carbon footprint of their 
shipments: by mode of transport, by journey and 
over a given period. 
As an extension of this service, CMA CGM is developing 
a new platform, EcoMonitor, which will be available 
to customers in 2023. It will be accessible online and 
will enable customers to ascertain the greenhouse 
gas emissions associated with the transport of their 
goods. 
In 2023, the Group will also launch the "Eco-Calculator 
door-to-door". This new eco-calculator will provide 
an estimate of the carbon footprint of each mode 
 
of transport. This will enable customers to choose 
 
the least polluting mix of multimodal solutions 
 
before placing their shipping order. 
CARBON EMISSION ANALYSES FOR CEVA LOGISTICS CUSTOMERS 
In 2021 and 2022, CEVA Logistics developed several 
digital tools to measure CO2 emissions for its internal 
and external stakeholders. Firstly, the company 
launched an eco-calculator available to customers, 
which provides an estimate of the CO2 emissions 
associated with a given journey and mode of transport. 
CEVA Logistics has also developed two tools for 
calculating CO2 emissions after the fact, which 
are based on actual shipments made over a given 
period. The first tool is available for our Contract Lead 
Logistics (fourth-party logistics (4PL)) customers, for 
air, maritime and road transport modes. The second 
tool is available for our third-party logistics (3PL) 
customers, for air and maritime transport modes.  
Finally, CO2 has been integrated in several forms 
into the MyCEVA digital solution. On this new 
CEVA Logistics booking platform, customers 
have access to : 
- 
an ocean offer that uses alternative energies, such 
as liquefied natural gas (LNG) or biofuel;  
- a carbon offset offer;  
- CO2 visibility during cotation
Developing solutions  
to reduce or offset emissions
SERVICE TO REDUCE OR OFFSET 
CARBON EMISSIONS  
Since 2020, Act With CMA CGM+ has offered its 
customers various services to reduce and offset their 
greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport. 
These include: 
- 
"Cleaner Energy LNG": combined with biomethane 
as guarantee of origin; 
- 
"Cleaner Energy Biofuel " Biodiesel (UCOME, 
Brown Grease*);
- 
"Positive Offset": 
 Offer to offset residual emissions 
via carbon credits. In addition, this product allows 
participation in a local agroforestry project
*With Clean Cargo, Smart Freight Centre offers a collaborative partnership between ocean container carriers, freight forwarders and 
shipment owners, which focuses on monitoring and reducing greenhouse gases from shipments of containers.
Clean Cargo member companies include major ocean freight buyers, freight forwarders and ocean container carriers. 
In 2022, CEVA Logistics added a new service, 
parcel delivery. This segment is very specific and 
the associated CO2 measurement is complex: 
 
it can be based on estimates, actual fuel 
consumption or averages. Colis Privé, a new 
subsidiary of CEVA Logistics, has extensive 
expertise in this area and has worked with 
two different service providers, TK Blue and 
4S. Therefore, Colis Privé is able to provide 
each customer with the carbon impact of their 
parcel. Based on this expertise, Colis Privé also 
piloted the development of an AFNOR standard 
 
for calculating the carbon footprint of last mile 
logistics.

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
Customers that choose Act With CMA CGM+ receive a statement 
showing the reduction of GHG emissions or their offsets. The reduction 
sections of these documents are verified by third parties.
Some CMA CGM customers communicate on CO2 reductions and 
offsets. For example, La Banane de Guadeloupe & Martinique places 
 
a QR Code on the "La Banane Française Equitable" ribbons to indicate 
transport using bio-fuel.
In 2022, Act With CMA CGM+ has reduced directly 
76,297 tonnes and indirectly 142,973 tonnes of CO2 
emissions for CMA CGM's customers and offset  
1,146,570 tonnes of CO2.
CEVA Logistics has rolled out the Green Ocean Offer, which offers 
the same services as ACT with CMA CGM+. It offers services to offset 
and reduce CO2 emissions from maritime transport through the use 
of alternative fuels. These are also offered on a case-by-case basis for 
air transport (Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)) and inland transport 
(Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO)). 
Since 2021, CEVA has offset the CO2 emissions of its Ocean LCL customers, 
which represents approximately 20000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per 
year. Offset projects are carried out in partnership with PUR Projet, 
an association that works to preserve biodiversity in Central America.
REUSING CONTAINERS  
IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION
For the past two years, CMA CGM has offered its customers in the 
Asia-Pacific region the possibility of reloading containers and avoiding 
empty trips with the Container Reuse offer. A digital platform facilitates 
orchestrating the reuse of empty containers by various actors as close 
as possible to the place where they are unloaded, and avoids returning 
the containers to their point of origin. This optimisation of road transport 
planning avoids empty trips and the associated carbon emissions. 
The CMA CGM Group enables shipowners 
to significantly improve their environmental 
performance with its "ACT with CMA CGM+" 
offer and the largest fleet of "e-methane ready" 
vessels.
Electrolux chose CMA CGM to transport 40,000 
TEUs of household appliances. The company, 
which specialises in the manufacture of household 
appliances, chose CMA CGM’s CLEANER 
 
ENERGY LNG solution. This low-carbon offer 
enables cargo to be transported on CMA CGM 
Group vessels equipped with dual-fuel LNG 
engines, combined with a share of guaranteed-
origin biomethane, which provides a 25% reduction 
in CO2 emissions throughout the value chain.
CMA CGM OFFERS INTERMODAL BARGE OR RAIL TRANSPORT  
TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS FROM INLAND TRANSPORT
For inland transport, the Group prioritises bulk 
and intermodal transport solutions to reduce its 
impact on the environment and endeavours to 
develop more sustainable, efficient and streamlined 
transport solutions. For the inland transport of goods, 
 
this means in particular a modal shift from road to rail 
or barge. In 2022, 64% of the Group’s inland freight 
was transported by rail or barge. Despite a shortage 
of these services and infrastructure in certain parts 
of the world, CMA CGM’s goal is to increase this 
share to 75% by 2025. 
For this purpose, the Group sets up block trains: 
 
this service, which has been developed for several 
years, consists of chartering a full train at regular 
intervals to transport containers from a maritime 
terminal to an inland terminal. By increasing volumes, 
it significantly reduces CO2 emissions. Block trains 
can transport 40 to 100 TEUs, over distances 
ranging from a few kilometres to several thousand. 
 
CMA CGM has developed numerous rail corridors 
on all continents. 
In 2022, the Group developed this mode of transport 
in China: 8 new block trains were launched in Hunan, 
Sichuan, Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces, with 
 
a total capacity of 740 TEUs per week. Our customers 
now have a very wide choice of 58 rail corridors in 
northern, central and southern China, with several 
departures each week linked to our 110 maritime 
transport services for goods exports and imports.
In France, four rail services were also introduced 
in 2022:
- Marseille - Duisburg 
- Fos-sur-Mer - Duisburg 
- Dunkirk – Paris, for a customer request
- Dunkirk – Miramas, for a customer request 
In the rest of the world, block trains were developed 
in Greece, Brazil, India, Malaysia and Egypt.
Whenever possible, the Group also operates road 
trains to reduce CO2 emissions. "Roadtrains*" have 
existed in Sweden since 2019. In 2022, Containership 
launched its first Road Train in Spain, allowing 
two containers to be transported with the same 
road tractor, thus reducing CO2 emissions by 45% 
 
compared to a traditional semi-trailer.

In 2022, CEVA Logistics shipped 39 049 TEUs by train*.  
CEVA LOGISTICS AND BARGE TRANSPORT
Whenever possible, CEVA Logistics offers its customers more 
environmentally friendly modes of transport. In cities with a river network, 
the company develops barge transport offers. In the Netherlands, 
 
it transports handling equipment from Nijmegen to Antwerp, with each 
barge replacing 18 trucks.
CEVA Logistics has also partnered with Absolutely and Livett’s Group 
to organise a river delivery service on the Thames. This pilot project 
should eventually remove 40,000 delivery trucks from London’s roads 
each year. 
In June 2022, CEVA Logistics conducted a pilot test with its subsidiary 
Colis Privé to evaluate the feasibility of delivering e-commerce parcels 
using the Rhône and Saône rivers. These containers were also unloaded 
and delivered using electric bikes.
Emergency aid transport 
The Humanitarian Services Office offers customised solutions 
 
to international organisations and NGOs providing emergency aid, 
 
in order to meet their specific transport and humanitarian logistics 
needs and to enable them to resolve and overcome any obstacles they 
may encounter until final delivery of the humanitarian supplies. In 2022, 
the Group handled the transport of 29,974 TEUs of emergency aid.
Supporting innovative  
start-ups

Responsible purchasing  
process  
For several years, CMA CGM Group has pursued a proactive Responsible 
Purchasing process and is committed to continuous improvement 
 
in line with the requirements of the Responsible Purchasing and 
Supplier Relations certification and its commitment to the principles 
 
of the UN Global Compact. This process contributes to the Group’s risk 
management and aims to create a positive social and environmental 
impact on the supply chain.  
THIRD PARTY CODE OF CONDUCT
The Third Party Code of Conduct defines the minimum standards required 
by CMA CGM Group, including CEVA Logistics, from its partners, 
 
in particular its suppliers and their employees and subcontractors. 
 
It applies to all of CMA CGM’s contractual relationships and its 
 
signature is a prerequisite for any partnership commitment.  
The Third Party Code of Conduct  
is available here: link.
THE WAY TO BUY: THE GROUP’S RESPONSIBLE 
PURCHASING POLICY  
To provide a framework for its purchasing practices, CMA CGM Group 
has drafted a reference document, The Way to Buy, which describes 
the fundamental principles of responsible purchasing and supplier 
relations. It focuses on:
- values, commitments and rules of conduct;
- 
sustainable purchasing best practices throughout the procurement 
process; 
- 
the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders in this purchasing 
process;  
- the supplier qualification process.  
This responsible purchasing policy encourages taking CSR criteria into 
account, in particular in invitations to tender. These criteria may relate 
to the CSR performance of the tenderers or to the CSR performance 
of the bids themselves (carbon impact, positive social impact).

This programme includes a compulsory e-learning 
course based on our purchasing policy, The Way 
 
to Buy, that was developed in 2021 and is addressed 
to the entire purchasing community. 
ASSESSMENT, MONITORING  
AND SUPPORT OF SUPPLIERS  
AND SUB-CONTRACTORS
In 2021, CMA CGM Group launched the Accelerate 
programme, designed to accelerate the assessment 
of its suppliers and fortify risk management. 
 
The assessment covers financial aspects, corruption, 
economic sanctions, and CSR issues. In 2022, 
 
the Group simplified its supplier evaluation process 
and prepared to extend it to its subsidiaries, 
 
in particular CEVA Logistics and the terminals.
 In 2022, more than 14,800 suppliers, 
accounting for approximately 75%  
of the expenditure in the maritime 
business, were assessed.
In 2023, CMA CGM Group will implement a supplier 
 
risk management tool that will reinforce their 
assessment, coordinate corrective action plans and 
monitor risks throughout the relationship with the 
Group. The CSR assessment method is based on 
 
a hierarchy of risk levels, depending on the type of 
purchase and the relevant country. The Group’s CSR 
experts have designed a risk mitigation plan to assist 
buyers in implementing corrective actions.
Finally, to encourage developing and maintaining 
balanced and long-lasting relationships with its 
suppliers, the Group conducted an awareness-raising 
campaign for the purchasing community and all 
stakeholders. Through this campaign, CMA CGM 
reiterated the importance of ethical and responsible 
management to treat suppliers in a fair, transparent, 
ethical and respectful manner.
As digitalisation is a tool for reinforcing and accelerating 
the responsible purchasing process, CMA CGM 
Group has launched a vast supplier data optimisation 
programme. This project aims to strengthen and 
harmonise the supplier onboarding process and 
 
to make supplier data more reliable throughout 
 
the term of their contract. 
In addition, the Group has set up a specific governance 
structure bringing together all stakeholders (risks, 
operational purchasing, CSR, finance, compliance, etc.) 
in order to assist buyers in implementing corrective 
actions, as well as to decide on continuing to do 
business with the suppliers most at risk. 
In 2022, CMA CGM Group focused its efforts on 
monitoring the most at-risk suppliers and initiated 
on-site audits accordingly. . 
RESPONSIBLE PURCHASING AT GEFCO  
Code of Ethics in terms of human rightshealth and 
safety, business ethics and environmental responsibility. 
The overall process includes: supplier surveys, 
 
pre-contracting risk analysis, including specific clauses 
in contracts and monitoring the progress of issues 
through regular reviews and audits.  
At the same time, GEFCO is working to provide 
buyers with individual incentive performance targets 
on responsible purchasing criteria.

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
Training hours
Change of scope between 2021 data (which covers 
86% of the total workforce) and 2022 data (which 
covers 98% of the workforce).
Share of women in the Top 200 by remuneration 
and share of non-French nationals in the Top 
200 by remuneration (%)
– 
The Top 200 means the 100 highest salaries at 
CMA CGM and the 100 highest salaries at CEVA 
Logistics.
Share of employees with access to health 
cover
– 
CMA CGM seafarers are excluded from the 
reporting scope. The scope covers 92.5% of the 
Group’s workforce.
– 
the calculation methodologies are similar between 
CMA CGM and CEVA:
• 
CMA CGM and CEVA consider that cover 
should include hospitalisation, treatments and 
outpatient consultations.
• 
CMA CGM and CEVA report the number of 
employees who have access to health cover 
proposed by the Group or by public authorities.
Maritime safety indicators
The scope of the maritime safety indicators 
includes owned vessels only (and therefore 
excludes chartered vessels and vessels managed 
by subcontractors). 
Maritime severity rate
– 
The scope of employees covered by this indicator 
is all seafarers who work for CMA CGM, including 
officer cadets and external organisations, except 
third-party vessel managers.
– 
The method for calculating days off work changed 
between 2021 and 2022. Days off work due to 
illness were included in the calculation in 2021, 
but ceased to be included in 2022. The calculation 
is as follows: total number of days lost divided by 
total number of hours worked, multiplied by 1,000.
Major maritime incidents indicator
A major maritime incident is an event that impacts 
the health and safety of the ship and crew, the 
environment (e.g. an oil leak) or the Group’s 
reputation or that has a significant financial impact. 
Major terminal and CCIS incidents indicator
A major incident at a terminal or depot is an 
event that impacts property, the environment not 
including major pollution (significant damage 
requiring immediate action), safety (a critical event 
following a safety breach), the Group’s reputation 
or that has a significant financial impact.
Maritime Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
(LTIFR)
– 
The total number of hours worked is the total 
number of days at sea of each vessel x 24 hours x 
the theoretical number of crew members aboard.
 Note: Lost-time accidents that occur after landing 
are not counted or consolidated because they are 
the responsibility of the shipowners.
Terminal safety indicators (frequency rate, severity 
rate, number of fatal accidents, number of major 
accidents).
The scope covers all terminals governed by the 
CMA CGM Terminals QHSE policy (excluding 
Brooklyn Kiev Port terminal in Ukraine), i.e. a total 
of 31 terminals.
CEVA safety Indicator 
The cover rate of safety indicator is 99%.
CCIS inland activities safety indicators (frequency 
rate, number of fatal accidents, number of major 
accidents).
The scope covers all employees subject to the CMA 
CGM Inland QHSE policy, which covers 88% of the 
QHSE workforce, i.e. 36 inland sites covered.
Percentage of countries that have launched at 
least one local initiative
A local initiative is a one-off or recurring volunteer 
initiative undertaken by a CMA CGM Group 
entity in which employees from one or more CMA 
CGM Group divisions participate. The scope of 
this indicator covers CMA CGM and includes the 
following entities: CMA CGM, ANL, MERCOSUL 
Line, APL, CNC and Containerships. 
ACTING FOR THE PLANET

– 
The consumption concerns the entire operational 
fleet (owned + chartered vessels) and includes the 
following types of fuel oil: HSFO, LSFO, MGO-
DO, LNG and biodiesel.
Alternative fuels
– 
The fuels included in the energy mix are biofuels 
and biomethane/LNG/bioLNG/synthetic 
methanes.
LNG-powered vessels in nominal TEU capacity
– 
Sum of the volume capacities of all chartered and 
owned LNG-powered vessels.
We consider the following information to be outside 
the scope of the Group’s activities:
- Combating food insecurity
- Preventing food waste
- Protecting animal welfare
- Responsible, fair and sustainable food
Details and methodological limitations 
 
of indicators.
Some indicators are reported for the Group’s 
consolidated scope, whereas others are reported for 
a more limited scope depending on their relevance 
or due to differences in calculation methods.
Scope: CMA CGM Group publishes consolidated 
non-financial information covering the Group’s 
scope, unless indicators are specific to a particular 
activity. However, the scope may also be limited on 
a case-by-case basis for certain indicators due to 
the maturity of the reporting process or differences 
in calculation methods. Any scope limitations with 
respect to the titles of the relevant indicators are 
explained in the Non-financial performance report. 
CMA CGM Group is committed to expanding, in 
the coming years, the reporting scope of indicators 
whose scope has been significantly restricted.
The data of the subsidiary Air Cargo is included as 
of 2022.
In 2022, CEVA Logistics integrated the subsidiaries 
GEFCO and Colis Privé. Their data will be included 
in the course of 2023. 
From 2023, the GEFCO brand will become CEVA 
Logistics. The name GEFCO appears in the Non-
financial performance report for 2022 because the 
subsidiary was still in existence in 2022.
Period: The reporting period runs from 1 January 
2022 to 31 December 2022.
.
ACTING FOR PEOPLE
For the breakdown of staff by age and gender, as 
well as new hires and departures, the scope covers 
98% of the total workforce and excludes stationary 
employees not included in C&Me.
Workforce and breakdown by age and gender
– 
The workforce covers the Group’s consolidated 
scope as of 31 December of the reporting period, 
with the exception of the limits stated above. 
This includes permanent contracts, fixed-term 
contracts, internships and international corporate 
volunteers.
New hires and departures
– 
«Intra-group» transfers are counted as movements. 
This means that any person who is transferred 
or who signs a new employment contract or a 
contractual amendment with a Group company is 
considered to be a new hire or a new departure.
Turnover rate
– 
This indicator reports the percentage of turnover, 
defined as the sum of the number of departures 
and new hires, divided by two, and divided by the 
average workforce. The scope includes CMA CGM 
stationary employees included in C&Me and CEVA 
Logistics employees.  
Share of women in management
– 
This indicator reports the number of women 
who hold management positions, i.e. female 
employees who directly supervise at least one 
employee.
– 
This indicator cover 90% of the Group’s 
workforce. The scope does not include french 
and internationals seafarers, as their contracts are 
not Group contracts, or sedentary employees not 
reported in C&Me.
Methodology
CSR indicators are updated annually. They were defined based on the 
UNGC’s 10 principles, the 17 Sustainable Development Objectives and 
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) criteria, as well as in compliance with 
obligations under French law (the «NRE Law» on new economic regulations 
of 15 May 2001), the European Union’s Non-Financial Reporting Directive 
and, to the extent possible, applicable international standards.

therefore excludes chartered vessels).
Sludge
– 
Sludge includes hydrocarbon waste, used fuel oil 
and oily water.
The amount of sludge generated is calculated on 
the basis of the sludge discharge quantities ordered 
by vessels before they arrive in the ports.
Biodiversity is not a salient issue for CEVA Logistics 
due to the nature and scope of its activities. CEVA 
Logistics does not yet report on waste but intends 
to do so in the next reporting period.
CEVA Logistics CO2 emissions
– 
CEVA Logistics reports on the energy consumption 
of its trucks and warehouses and on the associated 
Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions. This year, CEVA 
Logistics also reports its Scope 3 emissions from 
subcontracted maritime and air transport.
Energy consumption of warehouses
CEVA Logistics and associated CO2 emissions 
(Scope 1 & 2)
– 
This indicator concerns CEVA Logistics’ warehouses 
worldwide, both owned and leased, with the 
following coverage rates:  
• 
90% of global warehouse space in 2021.
• 99% of global warehouse space in 2022.
– 
Warehouses are included in the scope if operated 
during a full quarter.
– 
Energy consumption includes electricity, natural 
gas, domestic fuel oil, district heating and diesel 
for manual handling equipment and generators.
– 
Green electricity is the quantity of renewable 
or nuclear power produced and consumed or 
purchased under green power contracts.
– 
Carbon dioxide emissions are calculated on the 
basis of reported energy consumption applying 
emission factors specific to each country and/or 
type of energy.
– 
For certain warehouses (representing less 
than 25% of global warehouse space), energy 
consumption was estimated applying the kWh/
sqm ratio calculated for 2021 consumption of 
CEVA Logistics sites.
CO2 emissions associated with fuel 
consumption of the truck fleet (Scope 1)
– 
This indicator covers CEVA Logistics trucks, 
whether owned or leased (excluding personal 
vehicles and company cars). The scope covers 
activities in the following countries: Germany, 
Poland, India, Turkey, United Kingdom, United 
States, Canada, South Africa, Lebanon, Morocco, 
United Arab Emirates, Thailand, Brazil, Zambia, 
Malawi. Other countries subcontract all transport 
and therefore are not included in the reporting 
scope. 
– 
Carbon dioxide emissions are calculated on the 
basis of reported energy consumption applying 
emission factors specific to each type of energy.
CO2 emissions from maritime fleet fuel 
consumption (Scope 1)
– These emissions are obtained directly on the 
basis of fuel consumption. The following emission 
factors are applied to the fuel oil consumption of 
the maritime activity:
– 1 tonne of HSFO = 3.150 tonnes of CO2e
– 1 tonne of LSFO = 3.198 tonnes of CO2e
– 1 tonne of MGO/DO = 3.240 tonnes of CO2e
– 1 tonne of LNG = 2.75 tonnes of CO2e
– 1 tonne of biofuel = 0.049 tonnes of CO2e
CO2e emissions per loaded TEU and TEU-km 
 
– 
Scope: CMA CGM Group’s operating fleet (owned 
and chartered vessels) during the reporting 
period.
– 
TEU-km = nominal capacity of vessels * distance 
sailed.
CMA CGM’s Scope 3 CO2e emissions from 
maritime activities
– 
Scope 3 emissions are generated by the 
construction of ships and containers, the 
production of waste (solid and liquid) by ships, 
business travel by employees, the consumption of 
fuel for inland transport, and the upstream phase 
of production and transport of fuel consumed. 
– 
Shipbuilding: The impact is calculated on the 
basis of carbon dioxide emissions from the 
production of steel needed to build ships, which 
is itself measured based on the weight of the 
steel in the ships (emission factor of 2.21 tCO2e/
tonne of steel). We take into account the average 
number of ships built over a period of five years. 
Emissions from shipyards are unknown at present, 
but are assumed to be negligible. Emissions from 
chartered vessels are estimated on the basis of 
emissions from owned vessels, prorated per 
twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) km.
– 
Manufacturing containers: Emissions from 
manufacturing containers are estimated on the 
basis of the number of containers refurbished 
each year and converted into crude stainless 
steel (2.23 tonnes of steel per container). Steel 
emission factor = 2.21 tCO2e/tonne of steel 
(source FEDERIC/ADEME).
– 
Upstream fuel: Upstream carbon dioxide 
emissions are calculated using the following 
emission factors:
HFO
0.26 tCO2e/t
Source: EN 16258
DO
0.68 tCO2e/t
Source: EN 16258
VLSFO

Source: GLEC
BIOFUELS
0.554 tCO2e/t

Directive 
2018/2011
– 
Inland freight: We apply standard emission factors 
for each mode of transport (rail freight, road 
freight, barges) and depending on the country 
to calculate the corresponding carbon footprint 
before and after maritime transport. In addition, 
the calculation method changed in 2022 to take 
into account the transport of empty containers 
between warehouses.
– 
Solid waste: The volume of solid waste generated 
by owned vessels. Waste emissions from chartered 
vessels are estimated on the basis of emissions 
from owned vessels, prorated per twenty-foot 
equivalent unit (TEU) km.
– 
Sludge produced by vessels: As there is no 
commonly accepted emission factor for sludge, 
we apply the carbon dioxide emission factor for 
HFO (3.150 tCO2e/tonne HSFO). We apply this 
emission factor to the total quantity of sludge 
generated during the reporting period.
– 
Business travel: We estimate that a seafarer takes 
10 flights per year (round trip) and travels an 
average of 10,000 km per flight. We multiply this 
factor by the number of seafarers in the reporting 
year and by the ADEME emission factor of 0.083 
kg of CO2e/passenger for long-distance journeys.
– 
Commuting: We apply the ADEME emission factor 
for cars of 0.216 kg CO2e/km, and assume 20 
kilometres per day and 220 working days. 
SOx emissions from maritime activities:
– 
SOx emissions cover the entire operated fleet. 
They are calculated on the basis of fuel oil 
consumption per type of fuel oil and regulatory 
sulphur limits. Sulphur emissions captured by 
scrubbers are not included in total SOx emissions.

CMA CGM - 2022 CSR REPORT
CO2 emissions from subcontracted transport 
(Scope 3)
– 
This indicator covers air and maritime freight 
subcontracted on behalf of our customers. These 
CO2 emissions are calculated on the basis of the 
weight of goods transported, the departure and 
arrival points, and the emission factors provided 
by the GLEC Framework. When presented for 
CEVA Logistics only, maritime emissions include 
transport subcontracted to CMA CGM. When 
presented at CMA CGM Group level, these 
emissions are restated to avoid double counting 
of CMA CGM’s Scope 1 emissions.
– 
CO2 emissions from subcontracted transport 
exclude road and rail transport for technical 
reasons. Work is underway to enable including 
these emissions in the future. We estimate that 
they represent less than 10% of CEVA Logistics’ 
Scope 3 emissions at this time.
Greenhouse gas emissions of CEVA Logistics 
(excluding CO2)
CEVA Logistics does not generate substantial 
quantities of pollution due to the nature and scope 
of its operations.
ACTING FOR FAIR TRADE
Share of all whistleblower reports made that 
were processed and closed
– 
A Group platform has been set up for this 
purpose. This tool is available to all the Group’s 
internal and external stakeholders (employees, 
customers, suppliers, subcontractors, professional 
associations and trade unions). The distribution 
of alerts is communicated on the CMA CGM 
perimeter (excluding CEVA) in 2022.
Number of employees who received training 
on ethics and compliance issues
This indicator concerns office staff. The indicator 
covers eligible stationary employees, who account 
for 53% of the Group’s workforce. Employees 
who do not have an email address, employees 
of subsidiaries not controlled by CMA CGM, and 
employees on long-term leave are excluded.
Suppliers assessed
The scope covers the maritime activity of CMA 
CGM and all types of purchases (indirect, terminals, 
intermodal, chartering, CMA ships, bunkering, 
feedering, pool, P&T, logistics).
A supplier is defined on the basis of the supplier’s 
site. If CMA CGM purchases from two different sites 
of the same supplier, the Group counts two suppliers 
for the purpose of calculating the indicator.
Sustainable value-added services (Act with 
CMA CGM+ products)
– 
Scope: all TEUs booked worldwide by CMA CGM 
or any other Group company.
– 
Reduced and offset CO2 emissions: well-to-wake 
analysis covering emissions of the entire value 
chain.

investment funds.
Ex-post corrections:
– 
From 2022 onwards, the data «share of inland 
transport by inland waterway or rail’ includes the 
subsidiaries Mercosul and Contenership. This 
explains the decrease in the indicator between 
2021 and 2022.
– 
Starting in 2022, all greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions are reported in CO2 equivalent. The 
2021 data has also been updated.
– 
The 2021 figure for the percentage of the fleet 
retrofitted for shore power connection has been 
changed ex-post to take into account the number 
of owned vessels monitored in the financial 
statements.

Limited assurance conclusion
Based on the procedures we have performed, as described 
under the «Nature and scope of procedures» and the evidence 
we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that cause 
us to believe that the consolidated non-financial statement 
is not prepared in accordance with the applicable regulatory 
provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not 
presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines, in all 
material respects.
Comment
Without modifying our conclusion and in accordance with 
article A. 225-3 of the French Commercial Code, we have the 
following comment:
- 
The Group has continued to expand its CSR reporting 
scope. However, improvements remain to be made in the 
organization of reporting for the indicators Share of inland 
transport by rail or inland waterway, frequency and severity 
rates of workplace accidents for employees of terminals and 
CCIS inland activities, particularly in terms of applying the 
procedures and controlling information.
Reasonable assurance conclusion on a selection 
 
of non-financial information
Based on the procedures performed, as set out in the «Nature 
and scope of our work» and «Nature and scope of additional 
work on the information selected by the entity and identified by 
the sign √» sections of this report, and the evidences collected, 
the information selected by the entity and identified with the 
symbol √ in the Statement has been prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.
Preparation of the non-financial performance Statement
The absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting 
framework or a significant body of established practices on 
which to draw to evaluate and measure the Information allows 
for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can 
affect comparability between entities and over time.
Consequently, the Information needs to be read and understood 
together with the Guidelines, summarized in the Statement 
and available on the Entity’s website or on request from its 
headquarters.
Report by one of the Statutory  
Auditors, appointed as independent  
third party, on the verification  
of the consolidated non-financial  
statement
For the year ended 31 December 2022
 1. Accreditation Cofrac Inspection, number 3-1884, scope available at www.cofrac.fr
To the Annual General Meeting,
In our capacity as Statutory Auditor of your company (hereinafter the «entity») appointed as independent third party, and 
accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (COFRAC) under number 3-18841, we have undertaken a limited assurance 
engagement on the historical financial information (observed or extrapolated) in the consolidated non-financial statement, prepared 
in accordance with the entity’s procedures (hereinafter the «Guidelines»), for the year ended 31 December 2022 (hereinafter, 
the «Information» and the «Statement» respectively), presented in the Group’s management report pursuant to the legal and 
regulatory provisions of Articles L. 225 102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).
At the request of the entity, we conducted works designed to express a reasonable assurance conclusion on the information 
selected by the entity and identified by the sign √.
Inherent limitations in preparing the Information

As we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the 
Information as prepared by management, we are not permitted 
to be involved in the preparation of the Information as doing 
so may compromise our independence.
At the request of the entity and outside of the scope of 
certification, we may express reasonable assurance that the 
information selected by the entity, presented in the appendices, 
and identified by the symbol √ has been prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.
It is not our responsibility to report on the entity’s compliance 
with other applicable legal and regulatory provisions, including 
the compliance of products and services with the applicable 
regulations.
Applicable regulatory provisions and professional 
guidance
We performed the work described below in accordance with 
Articles A. 225-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, 
the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of 
Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires 
aux Comptes) applicable to such engagement, in particular the 
professional guidance issued by the Compagnie Nationale des 
Commissaires aux Comptes, «Intervention du commissaire aux 
comptes - Intervention de l’OTI - Déclaration de performance 
extra-financière», acting as the verification program, and with

at ensuring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements, ethical requirements and the professional 
guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors 
(Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) relating 
to this engagement.
Means and resources
Our work engaged the skills of twelve people between November 
2022 and March 2023 and took a total of approximately 
fourteen weeks.
We were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustainable 
development and corporate social responsibility. We conducted 
about twenty interviews with the people responsible for 
preparing the Statement.
Nature and scope of procedures
We are required to plan and perform our work to address the 
areas where we have identified that a material misstatement 
of the Information is likely to arise. 
The procedures we performed were based on our professional 
judgment. In carrying out our limited assurance engagement 
on the Information:
- 
We obtained an understanding of all the consolidated entities’ 
activities, and the description of the principal risks associated; 
- 
We assessed the suitability of the criteria of the Guidelines 
with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, 
neutrality and understandability, taking into account, where 
appropriate, best practices within the sector;

We verifi
 ed that the Statement provides the information 
required under article R. 225-105 II of the French Commercial 
Code, where relevant with respect to the main risks, and 
includes, where applicable, an explanation for the absence 
of the information required under article L. 225-102-1 III, 
paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code;
-  
We verifi
 ed that the Statement presents the business model 
and a description of principal risks associated with all the 
consolidated entities’ activities, including where relevant 
and proportionate, the risks associated with their business 
relationships, their products or services, as well as their 
policies, measures and the outcomes thereof, including key 
performance indicators associated to the principal risks;
- We referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:
•  
assess the process used to identify and confi
 rm the main 
risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including 
the key performance indicators used, with respect to the 
main risks and the policies presented;
•  
corroborate the qualitative information (measures and 
outcomes) that we considered to be the most important 
presented in Appendix. Concerning certain risk3, our work 
was carried out on the consolidating entity, for the other 
risks, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity 
and on a selection of entities4.
-  
We verifi
 ed that the Statement covers the scope of consolidation, 
i.e. all the consolidated entities in accordance with article L. 
233-16 of the French Commercial Code, within the limitations 
set out in the Statement;
-  
We obtained an understanding of internal control and risk 
management procedures the Entity has implemented and 
assessed the data collection process aimed at ensuring the 
completeness and fairness of the Information;
-  
For the key performance indicators and other quantitative 
outcomes that we considered to be the most important 
presented in Appendix, we implemented:
•  
analytical procedures to verify the proper consolidation 
of the data collected and the consistency of any changes 
in those data;
•  
tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify 
the proper application of defi
 nitions and procedures and 
reconcile the data with supporting documents. This work 
was carried out on a selection of contributing entities4 and 
covers between 15% and 100% of the consolidated data 
relating to the key performance indicators and outcomes 
selected for these tests;
-  
We assessed the overall consistency of the Statement based 
on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance review 
are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance opinion in 
accordance with the professional guidance of the French Institute 
of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires 
aux Comptes); a higher level of assurance would have required 
us to carry out more extensive procedures.
Nature and extent of additional work on the information 
selected by the entity and identifi
 ed by the sign √
With regard to the information selected by the entity, presented 
in the appendix and identifi
 ed by the symbol √ in the Statement, 
we conducted the same work as described in the paragraph 
«Nature and scope of our work» above for the Information 
considered to be the most important, but in a more in-depth 
manner, in particular with regard to the number of tests.
The selected sample accounts for 100% of the information 
identifi
 ed by the symbol √.
We believe that our work is suffi
 cient to provide a basis for our 
reasonable assurance opinion on the information selected by 
the entity and identifi
 ed by the symbol √.
