According to this study, only the UK and France have required the \nnon-financial information statement to be included in the annual management report rather than providing the option \nallowed by the NFRD to publish as a separate report. The Frank Bold paper posited that this requirement gives gravity \nand prominence to the non-financial reporting statement, which is circulated to shareholders on a yearly basis ahead \nof the general meeting. It went further to say that this approach also improves the integration of financial and non-\nfinancial reporting. Conversely, in Germany, if the non-financial information statement is not included in the annual \nmanagement report, it can be published on the company\u2019s website up to four months afterwards, provided that the \nannual management report refers to this publication and the website. The paper posited that this time lag means that \nshareholders whose attention is captured for the purposes of reviewing the annual management report and preparing \nfor the annual meeting, may be lost, and non-financial information may therefore not be given the same level of attention. \nThe Frank Bold paper noted that BASF (a German chemical company), Deutsche Bank and Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG have all \nsaid that providing information in a separate report would be a step backwards.\n",

From the preparers\u2019 perspective, many entities covered by the NFRD rely on manual processes, \nlarge teams, third-party consultants, and a variety of proprietary point solutions, such as business productivity software, \nemail, and general-purpose collaboration software, to provide the requested data and disclosure. Exacerbating these \nreporting challenges is the continued growth in size and complexity of many organisations with employees and data \nlocated all around the world. One of the issues identified is that traditional information management solutions may not \nprovide the agility, scalability and scope to economically permit a more comprehensive NFRD information management \nprocess. Physically connecting disparate information from internal and external data systems creates a costly information \nprocessing environment that is not adequate or agile enough to support both internal and external supply chain non-\nfinancial information sources.

The configuration of an organisation\u2019s control system \nand reporting system may vary across sustainability dimensions and type of company due to its size and activity. For \nexample, it is plausible that an organisation\u2019s environmental and financial control systems might be tightly coupled in cases \nwhere there is a clear association between environmental performance (e.g. energy efficiency and waste reduction) and \ncost reduction. On the other hand, it may be difficult to determine such an association with respect to social activities \n(e.g. engagement in community activities) and financial performance. Thus, there is a need for empirical evidence that \nexamines these differences so reporting alone may not be enough. NFRD reporting entities are seeking management \nsystems that can meet many versions of non-financial information reporting. Assessing relevant information from across \nthese comprehensive strategic areas is one of the most difficult tasks for NFRD reporting teams. It requires establishing \ncommon definitions for critical information and potentially rethinking the association between strategy drivers and the \nunderlying processes and related performance metrics. This often requires a better, more holistic approach to company \nKPIs \u2013 those that are integrated into the company\u2019s long-term strategy for value creation across all stakeholders.\n",

The longest environmental and climate related disclosure which did not include all the \nrequirements of the NFRD was 14 pages; the shortest disclosure which included all the relevant content categories was \njust 2 pages.

Some companies did include relevant climate-related disclosures within the annual report as \npart of a discussion on the business strategy in the directors\u2019 report or within the operating and financial review (which \nincludes a description of the future prospects of the business). However, the overwhelming majority provided relevant \nclimate-related disclosures within separate non-financial reports, sustainability reports or their Carbon Disclosure \nProject (CDP) reporting. EY notes that despite the call in the TCFD recommendations, there are several reasons why \nmost companies have not taken the step to include disclosures in their annual reports or directors\u2019 reports. The relative \nimmaturity of processes to capture and report on climate change risks is likely to be one reason, as well as the difficulty \nin setting timeframes on the potential implications of either transition or physical climate-related risks. It can also be \ndifficult to translate these risks into financial implications. However, shareholder resolutions, enforcement of listing rules \nand regulator focus is likely to force companies to change this in upcoming reporting periods.\n",
