While the world continues to live at the pace of the pandemic, the global economy's strong reco-very has led to an increase in trade, resulting in the growth of our business. Despite the difficult circumstances, our employees have shown exem-plary commitment and I would like to thank them for this. Throughout the year, we have accelerated our CSR strategy:  we have strengthened the three pillars on which it is based: acting for planet, people and fair trade. And we support the ini-tiatives and ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact. To take just a few examples:\u2013  We responded to the health crisis. Our prio-rity, of course, was to protect the health of our employees around the world - especially our seafarers, for whom vaccination was a major challenge. We also mobilised the Group's logis-tical expertise to continue to deliver medical supplies to the parts of the world that were hit hardest by the pandemic. \u2013  We have accelerated our energy transition, investing heavily to develop our 'e-methane ready' fleet powered by liquefied natural gas, which will include 44 vessels by 2024. And we have signed major partnerships to accelerate the development of alternative fuels. To support this ambition, we have joined the UN Global Compact's \"Race to Zero\" and are committed to achieving net-zero by 2050.\u2013  Our Foundation, which represents the Group's spirit of solidarity, has continued its initiatives to promote education for everyone. We created the social innovation incubator \"Le Phare\" in Marseille. We continued to respond to huma-nitarian emergencies by providing aid to popu-lations in distress and pursued our solidarity actions, particularly in Lebanon.   Our CSR policy is at the heart of our strategy. In addition to our economic footprint, we now consi-der our social, societal and environmental foot-print in every decision we make.Our objective is clear: to be an exemplary stakeholder in global supply chains. With our size, our position at the heart of world trade, our pioneering and entrepreneurial spirit, we can and we want to lead our clients, our partners and our entire sector towards a virtuous dynamic.Aware of our responsibilities and strengthened byour human and family values, we are more deter-mined than ever to continue this transformation.",

The conclusions of the sixth IPCC report published in August 2021, coupled with the growing num-ber of warnings and \"calls to action\" from major stakeholders to limit global warming, have further strengthened our determination to drastically reduce our carbon emissions. In 2020, we are committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This year we are going fur-ther by joining the Race to Zero launched by the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) initiative. It is a global campaign that mobilises a coalition of \"Net Zero Carbon\" initiatives. Net-Zero goes beyond carbon neutrality by focusing on emission reductions rather than offsets. As of 31/12/2021, 4475 institutions, companies or NGOs are com-mitted to achieving Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050. Together, these players cover almost 25% of global CO emissions and more than 50% of GDP. CMA CGM has decided to invest in this \"Race to Zero\" and thus demonstrate its commitment to climate protection and biodiversity. ",

As a result, we have noticed a growing integration of CSR issues within the various departments and operational functions so that CSR can be integrated as closely as possible into our core business.As part of an approach to structuring actions, the CSR teams are being strengthened to ensure the definition of trajectories, priorities, quantified objectives and action plans, as well as the coordi-nation and support of projects. CSR projects are monitored using performance and impact indicators that reflect ambitious objectives in line with the Group's 12 priorities. Among these indicators, around twenty are objectified and monitored every quarter to be presented to the CSR Executive Committee. The members of the CSR Executive Committee are responsible, together with their teams, for achieving the CSR performance targets.All of this is regularly reported to the Board of Directors.",

By 2024, our fleet will have at least 44 LNG-powered vessels. This new equipment will enable the use of renewable energies to propel our vessels (gases such as biomethane and synthetic methane). To make this decarbonization strategy a reality, the Group is also investing in the production of biomethane and setting up strategic partnerships with its suppliers.Convinced that decarbonization of the Group requires a mix of solutions, we are investing in research and development (R&D) to design the clean vessels of the future and are working to continuously improve the performance of our assets.",

At the same time, we are making progress on other alternative energies such as electricity and green hydrogen for our other needs (quay equipment, cranes or machinery). New technologies will also allow us to optimise our operations and thus reduce our consumption to a minimum. We already do this with the help of algorithms that allow us to adapt the route of our ships or optimise their loading. To limit our consumption, we also invest significantly in the engineering of our ships. We are developing innovative designs that will take to the sea in a few months. \u00bb",

We take into account the average number of ships produced over 5 years. Emissions from construction sites are unknown at present but are assumed to be negligible. Emissions from chartered vessels are estimated from the emissions of owned vessels, pro-rata by twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU).\u2013  Container construction: Emissions from container manufacturing are estimated from the number of containers refurbished each year and converted to raw stainless steel (2.2 tonnes of steel per container). Steel emission factor = 2.21.\u2013  Upstream fuel and Energy: Upstream carbon dioxide emissions are calculated using the following emission factors:Sources : Sources : Sources :  Sources :  Sources :  Red 2009/28\u2013  Land freight: We apply standard emission factors for each mode of transport (rail freight, road freight, barges) to calculate the corresponding carbon foot-print before and after sea freight.\u2013  Solid waste the volume of solid waste generated by owned vessels. Waste emissions from chartered ves-sels are estimated from the emissions of owned vessels, pro-rata to the twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) km.\u2013  Sludge produced by vessels: In the absence of a com-monly accepted emission factor for sludge, we apply the emission factor for carbon dioxide. We apply this emission factor to the total amount of sludge produced during the reference period.\u2013  Business travel: We estimate that a pilot makes 10 flights per year (round trip) and travels an average of 10,000 km per flight. We multiply this factor by the number of passengers in the reference year and by the ADEME emission factor of 0.083 kg COe/passenger for long-distance travel. emissions CEVA Logistics:\u2013  CEVA Logistics reports warehouses & trucks energies consumption and associated CO emissions scope 1 and 2  Maritime fleet fuel consumption: \u2013  The consumption concerns the entire operational fleet (owned + chartered vessels).

Our firm maintains a comprehensive sys-tem of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with applicable legal, regulatory and ethical requirements and the pro-fessional guidance issued by the French Institute of Sta-tutory Auditors relating to this engagement.Means and resourcesOur work was carried out by a team of nine people between October 2021 and March 2022 and took a total of approximately fourteen weeks.We were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustai-nable development and corporate social responsibility. We conducted some twenty interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Statement.Nature and scope of our workWe planned and performed our work to address the areas where we identified that a material misstatement of the Information was likely to arise.

Concerning certain riskour work was carried out on the consolidating entity, for the other risks, our work was carried out on the consoli-dating entity and on a selection of entities\u2013  We verified that the Statement covers the scope of consolidation, i.e. all the consolidated entities in accor-dance with article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code, within the limitations set out in the Statement;\u2013  We obtained an understanding of internal control and risk management procedures the entity has put in place and assessed the data collection process to ensure the completeness and fairness of the Information;\u2013  For the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes that we considered to be the most important, as presented in Appendix, we implemented:\u2022  analytical procedures to verify the proper consolida-tion of the data collected and the consistency of any changes in those data;\u2022  tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the proper application of the definitions and procedures and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. This work was carried out on a selection of contributing entities and covers between 25% and 100% of the consolidated data selected for these tests;\u2013  We assessed the overall consistency of the Statement based on our knowledge of all the consolidated enti-ties.The procedures performed in a limited assurance enga-gement are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement performed in accordance with the profes-sional guidance issued by the French Institute of Sta-tutory Auditors; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.Nature and extent of additional work on the infor-mation selected by the entity and identified by the sign \u221aWith regard to the information selected by the entity, presented in the appendix and identified by the symbol \u221a in the Statement, we conducted the same work as des-cribed in the paragraph \"Nature and scope of our work\" above for the Information considered to be the most important, but in a more in-depth manner, in particular with regard to the number of tests.The selected sample accounts for 100% of the informa-tion identified by the symbol \u221a.We believe that our work is sufficient to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion on the information selected by the entity and identified by the symbol \u221a.",
