DISCLAIMER
This appendix forms part of a series of seven documents, comprising the report and its appendices prepared by the European 
Lab Project Task Force on preparatory work for the elaboration of possible EU non-financial reporting standards (PTF-NFRS), 
for submission to the European Commission in response to a mandate including a request for technical advice dated 25 June 
2020.
The contents of the PTF-NFRS report and its appendices are the sole responsibility of the PTF-NFRS. The European Lab 
Steering Group Chair has assessed that appropriate quality control and due process had been observed to the extent possible 
within the context of the relevant mandate and the timeframe allowed, and has approved the publication of the PTF-NFRS 
report and its appendices. The PTF-NFRS report and its appendices do not represent the official views of EFRAG and are not 
subject to approval by the EFRAG governance bodies: EFRAG General Assembly and the EFRAG Board; or the European Lab 
Steering Group.
As regards the views expressed in the PTF-NFRS report and its appendices the following observations and clarifications 
should be noted:
•	 the PTF-NFRS report taken as a whole reflects a very large consensus;
•	 it is understood that members of the PTF-NFRS are not expected to endorse each and every one of the 54 detailed 
proposals in the PTF-NFRS report and may have different views on some of them;
•	 in addition the views expressed may not reflect the views of the organisations or entities to which individual PTF-NFRS 
members may belong;
•	 the assessment work for the different project focus areas, presented in Appendices 4.1 to 4.6 to the PTF-NFRS report, 
was the result of separate sub-groups of the PTF-NFRS, for which only peer review within the PTF-NFRS was performed.
Links are included in the PTF-NFRS report and its appendices to facilitate readers accessing the reference or source material 
mentioned. All such links were active and functioning at the time of publication.

Stream A6 assessed the current situation of non-financial reporting for the following three dimensions of standard-
setting:
a)	Content: What is disclosed? How is it disclosed?
b)	Classification: Where is the information located? Does the required information have an address / taxonomy of data?
c)	 Reporting format: How is the information reported?
2	
The analysis focused primarily on the reporting practices followed by EU companies under the scope of the Non-
Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD)1. The analysis took the form of desktop research that involved reviews of published 
research and data analysis.
3	
Stream A6 observes that the large and increasing number of reporting requirements and frameworks, together with 
their heterogeneity (in scope, objective, implementation – voluntary or mandatory, technology, etc.), are a source of 
numerous inconsistencies in reporting practices. The assessment of Stream A6 is that these ultimately fail to address 
users’ needs while being a burden for preparers of non-financial information, whose specificities and capacities (from 
large companies to SMEs) are not sufficiently considered.
4	
Stream A6 finds that from a digitisation perspective, the non-financial reporting ecosystem is diversified in many ways, 
inflating costs, creating operational and compliance risks, and ultimately hampering access.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES
5	
Based on the workplan that was presented and adopted by the PTF during its kick-off meeting on 11 September 2020, 
Stream A6 focused on the following assessment objectives:
a)	To assess management reporting diversity, in terms of what, where and how non-financial information is currently 
reported;
b)	To identify the hurdles and challenges faced by preparers of non-financial information, including a specific focus on 
the practices and experience of small and medium-sized entities (SMEs);
c)	 To review the experience and feedback of users (whether current non-financial information reporting practices are 
meeting their needs and which changes might be beneficial); and
d)	To assess the digitisation progress.
6
6	
The starting point for the Stream A6 assessment was the rich – and partly confusing – diversity of non-financial reporting 
channels that currently exist and that give rise to many questions. 
FRAMING OF THE WORK
Context
7	
The PTF was requested to provide technical advice for a possible future non-financial reporting standard setter. Any 
such standard setting has three dimensions: 
a)	Content: What is disclosed? How is it disclosed?
b)	Classification: Where is the information located? Does the required information have an address / taxonomy of data?
c)	 Reporting format: How is the information reported?
Scope
8	
Stream A6 assessed the current situation of non-financial reporting for each of the three dimensions mentioned above.
9	
The analysis focused primarily on the reporting practices followed by EU companies under the scope of the NFRD. The 
analysis mostly took the form of desktop research, based on reviews of published research and data analysis.
Objectives
10	
Stream A6 sought to evaluate the following questions:
a)	How is non-financial information produced? The evaluation focused on:
(i)	
Regulatory and/or voluntary context 
	
On what basis do companies report? Do they report to meet regulatory requirements, other mandatory 
obligations or on a voluntary basis? What are the relevant rules? What are the trickle-down effects of mandatory 
reporting requirements applicable for large entities, into disclosure requests towards SMEs along the supply 
chain? Is external assurance required, and if so, which level?
(ii)	
Company reporting
	
How many companies and which companies report? Under which context, in which sectors and of which size? Is 
there uniform reporting across industries/countries?
(iii)	
Frameworks, standards and guidance
	
What are the frameworks, standards and guidance most frequently used to produce non-financial information 
and by what type of companies? Do companies use single or multiple references to fit their needs?
b)	How is non-financial information provided? This question focused on:
(i)	
Classification/taxonomy
	
How is the information classified? Is a specific taxonomy applied?
(ii)	
Format
	
How is the information reported? Do companies use special platforms, websites, registration document filings or 
other formats?
DETAILED ANAL
YSIS OF  
THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY
7
(iii)	
Location
	
Where is non-financial information found in companies’ publications (combined management report with financial 
report, separate sustainability report, registration documents, elsewhere…)?
(iv)	 Technology
	
What kind of technology is used to provide non-financial information? What is the progress of digitisation in non-
financial reporting? Does digitisation play an important role?
Additional comment: Digitisation is a way of submitting content. How to improve and expand its use is an essential 
consideration for improvement of non-financial reporting, but the pressing need is about format: Where does the 
digitised content go? How was it produced? Is it verifiable?
c)	 What challenges are faced when producing or using the provided non-financial information, both from a preparer and 
a user perspective with focus on:
(i)	
Content: What are the issues faced with what is reported? 
(ii)	
Structure: How is non-financial information reported?
(iii)	
Technology: What are the means used to report non-financial information?
Approach
11	
Stream A6 conducted its assessment through a desktop review of relevant publicly available literature and data 
analysis. As such, most statements in this assessment report reflect the content of this literature and data analysis. 
These statements are synthesised and summarised into salient observations, for the Stream A6 own assessment and 
conclusion.
12	
The full list of documents reviewed is provided in the Appendix to this assessment report. The most relevant sources for 
the information included in this assessment report were the following:
a)	An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, 
Alliance for Corporate Transparency (2019). This document has been used as the primary source of information 
throughout the document, as it contains detailed data research on a significant number of companies under the NFRD 
scope, and its structure is aligned with the NFRD.
b)	Carrots & Sticks – Sustainability reporting policy: Global trends in disclosure as the ESG agenda goes mainstream, 
GRI and University of Stellenbosch Business School (2020)
c)	 Insights into integrated reporting 4.0: The story so far, ACCA (2020)

SECTION 1: HOW NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS PRODUCED
13	
Non-financial reporting is mandated and/or shaped by specific legislation and by the rules of various bodies, from public 
agencies to stock exchanges. This contributes to a complex context that drives non-financial reporting diversity.
14	
The first aspect of the Stream A6 assessment involved research on how non-financial information is produced by 
preparers. The assessment addressed the matter from three different angles, namely regulatory and/or voluntary 
context, company reporting and frameworks/standards/guidance used.
Regulatory/voluntary context
QUESTION 1.1:
What is the context (regulatory/voluntary) in which non-financial information is developed?
15	
Based on information included in two reports published by Accountancy Europe2,3 (hereafter ‘the Accountancy Europe 
reports’), the countries in Europe where non-financial reporting is required by law, regulation or is otherwise mandatory 
are listed below:
a)	EU274: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, 
Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, 
Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden;
b)	Europe (other than EU27)5: United Kingdom, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Liechtenstein.

In Croatia, Cyprus and Ireland the European enforcer does not have powers relating to the non-financial statement.
5	
In Norway, the Accounting Directive, including Articles 19a and 29a, is not yet finally transposed into national legislation.

16	
According to the Accountancy Europe reports and a study by EY Italy6 all EU countries have already transposed the 
NFRD and have enacted legislation regarding non-financial reporting. Tables 1 and 2 below include the main relevant 
applicable laws:

Most of the NFRD provisions have been similarly transposed by EU Member States. However, there is a significant degree 
of implementation diversity at national level, as the transposition of the NFRD has been significantly adapted on certain 
matters. These adaptations include which companies are subject to non-financial reporting regulatory requirements, 
the definition of public interest entities (PIEs), disclosure formats and non-compliance penalties. Figure 1 summarises the 
implementation of the NFRD by EU Member States according to the Accountancy Europe reports.

Which companies are subject to non-financial reporting regulatory requirements?
18	
EU Member States have different definitions for what constitutes large undertakings subject to non-financial reporting 
obligations. Based on information in the Accountancy Europe reports, the companies subject to non-financial reporting 
regulatory requirements in Europe are determined by dimensional criteria as set out in Table 3 (EU27) and Table 4 (other 
than EU27), based on 2017 and 2019 data.

Definition of PIEs
19	
Another report published by Accountancy Europe ‘Definition of Public Interest Entities in Europe’8, shows that EU Member 
States also have different definitions for what constitutes PIEs.
20	
There is a wide diversity of definitions of PIEs applicable across European countries. While some countries have 
implemented the minimum requirements, others, implicitly or explicitly, set a broader PIE definition, extending the scope 
of the definition to entities such investment companies, large non-listed companies according to specific size criteria, 
state-owned companies, pension funds etc. In other countries (including France, Slovenia, Sweden and the UK), there is 
no explicit definition of PIEs included in the local law. Instead, groupings of types of entities have been determined on 
which different requirements apply.

Disclosure formats and non-compliance penalties
21	
Based on information included in the Accountancy Europe reports9,10 and the previously mentioned study by EY Italy11, in 
some countries, as set out in Table 5, specific provisions are included in national law relating to disclosure formats and 
non-compliance penalties.

22	
In addition to specific non-financial reporting regulatory requirements, some stock exchanges have issued rules and 
guidance regarding non-financial information reporting. An estimated 64% of EU stock exchanges have published 
written guidance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting while 73% provide an SME listing platform13.
Involvement of auditors or other assurance providers
23	
National regulatory requirements also differ significantly in respect of provisions relating to the involvement of auditors 
and assurance over reported non-financial information. A factsheet published by Accountancy Europe ‘Towards reliable 
non-financial information across Europe’14 shows that out of the 26 European countries covered (as of February 2020):
a)	12 countries apply the minimum requirement for the statutory auditors to check whether non-financial information has 
been provided;
b)	11 countries include an additional requirement for the auditors to check the consistency of non-financial information 
reported with the financial statements;
c)	 3 countries opted for mandatory independent assurance of the non-financial information reported; and
d)	14 countries opted for voluntary independent assurance.

25	
While it might be reasonably assumed that consistency checks and assurance requirements lead to higher levels 
of completeness, consistency and quality in non-financial information reporting, Stream A6 was not able to identify 
published research in this respect establishing whether such correlation currently exists.
QUESTION 1.2:

How many companies report to meet regulatory requirements or other mandatory obligations on a voluntary basis?
26	
While many companies in the EU are subject to non-financial reporting laws and regulations, that number falls significantly 
short of the entire population of companies of the respective size. In particular:
a)	EU rules on non-financial reporting cover approximately 6 000 large companies and groups across the EU16, compared 
to a total of 38 368 large companies and of 16 616 PIEs in the EU (2017)17.
b)	Stock exchange regulations apply to a total of 7 770 listed companies in the EU, and only 6 300 of these (81%), 
possibly including SMEs, cover sustainability reporting in some way in their annual filings (2019)18.

27	
Only a limited number of companies disclose (on a mandatory or voluntary basis) non-financial information today. In fact, 
the number of companies, particularly SMEs, disclosing information in accordance with non-financial regulation is not 
known. 
28	
Public disclosure on sustainability topics is limited even amongst large companies. This is driven by the fact that many 
large companies fall outside the scope of the NFRD in the EU. In the absence of official figures, Stream A6 has sourced 
relevant non-financial information reporting data from analytics and ratings firms. 
29	
The information presented as Figure 4 below was obtained from Ecovadis19. For considering this information it should be 
emphasised that Ecovadis uses different size definitions to the NFRD20:
Figure 4: % of companies publicly disclosing sustainability information
Source: Ecovadis
19	
Ecovadis is a sustainability ratings platform that assesses corporate social responsibility and sustainable procurement and that contains data from more than 
65 000 companies globally.
20	 Ecovadis define company size using the following criteria: 
	
• SMEs: up to 999 employees; 
	
• Large companies: more than 1000 employees.
16

Frameworks/standards/guidance
QUESTION 1.3:
What are the frameworks/standards/guidance most frequently used to produce non-financial information and by what type 
of companies?
30	
Reporting entities rely on many different initiatives, local and international, generic or industry/topic based for their non-
financial information disclosures. The NFRD explicitly references some of these.
31	
The most relevant frameworks, standards and guidance used to support the production of non-financial information, are 
shown in Table 6 below. The source of the data used to arrive at the percentage numbers disclosed in Table 6 are the 
Alliance for Corporate Transparency 2019 Research Report ‘An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies 
pursuant to the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive’21 (hereafter the “2019 ACT report”) and a report published by 
ACCA ‘Insights Into Integrated Reporting 4.0: The Story So Far’22.

From Table 6, it can be seen that many companies use more than three frameworks/standards/guidance, mostly in a 
global context. It can also be reasonably deduced that these standards are complementary to each other, with some of 
them being generic while others are topic or sector specific.

SECTION 2: HOW NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED
33	
The second aspect of the Stream A6 assessment involved research on how non-financial information is provided. 
The assessment addressed the matter from four different perspectives, namely classification, location, format, and 
technology.
Classification
QUESTION 2.1:

What topics are most reported upon and by what types of entities?
34	
This question requires both an evaluation of the non-financial reporting topics dealt with companies and the degree to 
which the disclosure has been addressed. Considering this from several possible classification angles, the assessment 
was structured by following the topic classification and level of disclosure as articulated in the NFRD. 
35	
The 2019 ACT report24 forms the backbone of this analysis. Where possible, this was supplemented with additional data 
from other sources, and in particular with TCFD data on climate-related disclosures.
36	
In the 2019 ACT report, topics are presented under the NFRD classification in the following way:

The 2019 ACT report finds that a great majority of companies address climate change in their disclosure (90,9%). This 
could reflect the increased demands in recent years from investors and other stakeholders for disclosure around 
climate risk, whether due to mandatory requirements or voluntary reporting initiatives. Climate risk has been a focus of 
established reporting standards, frameworks and principles including GRI, CDP and CDSB, as well as the NFRD. 
40	
Disclosure on waste is the second most frequent topic, but with varying levels of disclosure provided, as shown later in 
paragraph 66.
19
19
41	
The 2019 ACT report indicates that only a minority of companies cover biodiversity and ecosystem conservation in their 
reports, as further elaborated in paragraph 67.
42	
This conclusion on biodiversity and ecosystem conservation, however, is not consistent across all sectors, as companies 
in certain high-risk sectors such as the Energy & Resource Extraction and Infrastructure, typically do provide such 
disclosure. Yet, in other high-risk sectors such as Apparel & Textiles, Hospitality & Recreation and Food & Beverages, 
the percentage of companies disclosing on this topic is strikingly low.
43	
Size emerges as a key criterion for environmental disclosures, as the proportion of companies providing relevant 
disclosures increases for all climate change topics as turnover increases. This is shown in Table 9.

Climate change
44	
The European Commission issued non-binding guidelines on climate-related reporting in June 201925. This guidance 
aims to provide companies with recommendations on how to better report the impact of their activities on climate, whilst 
also providing meaningful disclosures on the impacts of climate change on their business. These guidelines integrate the 
TCFD recommendations as the de facto framework on climate-related disclosures. The guidelines include 85 provisions 
which explicitly address climate-related matters; while 42 address pollution, waste and hazardous substances; 33 cover 
environmental compliance and risks; and 30 refer to water.

This research found that 82% of companies already report on climate change-related policies while more than 70% 
address outcomes in this category to some degree.

However, as shown in Figure 7, significant differences are observed by industry on certain key issues such as setting 
targets or identifying risks.

In its 2020 report ‘Falling short? Why environmental and climate-related disclosures under the EU Non-Financial 
Reporting Directive must improve’26, the CDSB identified the top 3 strengths of disclosure, demonstrating a clear pattern 
in areas of good practice. In this report the CDSB reviewed the 2019 environmental and climate-related disclosures 
of Europe’s 50 largest listed companies, with a combined market capitalisation of USD 4.3 trillion, under the NFRD. It 
26	 Falling short? Why environmental and climate-related disclosures under the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive must improve, CDSB (2020)
21
21
identified the following three areas as strength categories: (i) key performance indicators (KPIs), (ii) policies and due 
diligence, and (iii) business model.
49	
For some of the companies in the CDSB sample, KPIs were one of the most mature aspects of their non-financial 
disclosure, however it was also an element where substantive variation in quality was observed.
50	
All companies in the CDSB review sample disclosed climate or environmental KPIs, with the most frequently reported 
metrics being (i) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (100%), (ii) water consumption, withdrawals or intensity (88%), and (iii) 
energy consumption, intensity or generation (86%).
51	
Overall, policies and due diligence were among the most consistent areas of environmental and climate-related 
disclosures, with 100% of companies describing their policies and 94% disclosing their due diligence arrangements. 
Although almost all companies disclosed these content categories, significant variation in the extent and quality of 
disclosures was observed. As ‘policies’ and ‘due diligence’ are not defined within the NFRD, there was variation in how 
companies interpreted these terms.
52	
88% of the companies reviewed by CDSB disclosed some environmental and climate-related aspects of their business 
model, however only one-third did so in a manner that addressed the key aspects outlined in the guidelines to the 
NFRD.
53	
In the 2020 status report of the TCFD27 (hereafter ‘the 2020 TCFD status report’), it was noted that nearly 60% of 
the world’s 100 largest public companies supported the TCFD, reported in line with the TCFD recommendations28, or 
both. This 2020 TCFD status report noted that disclosure of climate-related financial information, aligned with the TCFD 
recommendations, had steadily increased since the recommendations were published in 2017. The report also noted a 
continued need for progress given the urgent demand for consistency and comparability in reporting.
54	
More specifically, the 2020 TCFD status report, which provides findings from the review of financial filings, annual 
reports, integrated reports, and sustainability reports of 1 701 public companies from 69 countries across eight industries, 
highlights that:
a)	42% of companies with a market capitalisation greater than USD 10 billion disclosed at least some information in line 
with each individual TCFD recommendation in 2019.
b)	Approximately 60% of the world’s 100 largest public companies support the TCFD, report in line with the TCFD 
recommendations, or both.
c)	 Energy companies, and Materials and Buildings companies, are leading on disclosure, with an average level of TCFD-
aligned disclosures of 40% for Energy companies and 30% for Materials and Buildings companies in fiscal year 2019.
d)	Expert users of disclosure identified the impact of climate change on a company’s business and strategy as the ‘most 
useful’ information for financial decision-making. Notably, this information has the lowest level of disclosure across the 
recommendations, with just one in 15 companies providing this disclosure.
55	
Disclosure of climate-related information has increased since 2017 both in terms of the number of companies reporting 
and the quality of such reporting. However, companies’ disclosure of the potential financial impact of climate change on 
their businesses, strategies, and financial planning remains low.
56	
As shown in Figure 8 below, the greatest increase in the percentage of companies disclosing relevant information from 
2017 to 2019 – 11 percentage points –relates to the disclosure of processes for identifying and assessing climate-related 
risks (TCFD recommendation: Risk Management a); whilst the smallest increase relates to the disclosure of companies’ 
climate-related risks and opportunities (TCFD recommendation: Strategy a), which increased by only one percentage 
point over the same time period. Additionally, while the percentage of disclosure for the five recommended disclosures

22
related to governance and risk management is low, the percentage point increases for those five recommended 
disclosures are higher than the increases for the recommended disclosures related to strategy and metrics and targets.
Figure 8: Percentage of companies that disclosed information aligned with TCFD recommended disclosures in 2019
Source: 2020 Status Report: Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, TCFD (2020) – page 11
57	
The review for the TCFD 2020 status report found that, on average, information aligned with the recommended 
disclosures was more likely to be disclosed in sustainability reports than in financial filings or annual reports. However, 
disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities was nearly as likely to be found in financial filings or annual reports 
as it was in sustainability reports. In the case of metrics and targets, the review found that 79% of sustainability reports 
included information aligned with recommended disclosures for metrics and targets, compared to only 15% of annual 
reports and financial filings containing the equivalent information.
58	
One in 15 companies reviewed disclosed information on the resilience of its strategy. The review found that the 
percentage of companies disclosing the resilience of their strategies, taking into consideration different climate-related 
scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario, was significantly lower than that of any other recommended disclosure in 
23
23
each year. These results are consistent with feedback which the TCFD has received from companies on the challenges 
of disclosing such information.
59	
Companies’ disclosure of their specific climate-related issues stayed constant, indicating that few companies have 
revised their perspective on whether climate-related risks and opportunities are appropriate for inclusion in public 
reporting.
60	
The percentage of companies disclosing TCFD-aligned information tends to increase with company size. On average, 
42% of companies with a market capitalisation of greater than USD 10 billion disclosed information aligned with the TCFD 
recommendations in 2019, while the average was 15% for companies with a market capitalisation less than USD 2.8 billion.
61	
Companies in Europe were found to have the highest percentages of TCFD-aligned disclosures for 10 of the 11 
recommended disclosures. This may, in part, be due to the integration of the TCFD recommendations in the non-binding 
guidelines on climate-related reporting published by the European Commission in June 201929. The Asia Pacific region 
followed Europe with the second highest percentage of disclosure for 8 of the 11 recommended disclosures. While the 
North American region had the highest percentage of disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities, the Latin 
America, Middle East and Africa, and North American regions otherwise had broadly similar percentages of disclosure 
across the recommended disclosures. 
62	
The conclusions of the TCFD 2020 status report were supported by research carried out by Moody’s Analytics for 
a study which reviewed the climate-related disclosures of roughly 12 000 companies. According to the TCFD 2020 
status report the Moody’s Analytics study found that about 17% of the companies reviewed reported climate-related 
information. The TCFD 2020 status report further notes that Vigeo Eiris, an affiliate of Moody’s, also conducted an 
independent analysis reviewing almost 3 000 companies across regions and sectors, and found that most companies 
lag in terms of fully aligning with the TCFD recommendations.
63	
The TCFD 2020 status report analysed and ranked disclosures by industry (see Figure 9 below). A higher average 
percentage of disclosure indicates that an industry generally disclosed at a higher rate across the 11 recommended 
disclosures. Energy companies had the highest average at 40%, with the highest disclosure percentage for 9 of the 
11 recommended disclosures, while Materials and Buildings companies had the highest percentage for 2 of the 11 
recommendations. Consumer Goods and Technology and Media Companies had the lowest percentage of disclosure 
in several areas, with overall disclosure averages at 18% and 13%, respectively.

Given the discretionary nature of disclosing human rights issues, it is interesting to see how few companies consider any 
human rights dimension for disclosure purposes, particularly on topics that have a cross-sectoral impact, such as data 
protection of the supply chain. Figure 15 below was prepared using information from the 2019 ACT report.

70	
According to the 2019 ACT report, corporate disclosure on human rights is often narrative and case specific. 
Methodologies that allow to report on human rights in quantitative terms are not common, which in broad terms can be 
explained by the very nature of the matter, namely, that quantifying human rights issues and impacts is challenging.
71	
For the purposes of the research leading to the 2019 ACT report, the methodology adopted for the assessment of 
human rights related disclosures focused on general criteria was derived from the UN Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights Reporting Framework, concerning the identification of the salient human rights issues by companies 
and their management. It was stated that these criteria naturally fitted the categories of information the NFRD requires 
companies to report on, namely policies and due diligence procedures, outcomes, principal risks and KPIs. This approach 
leaves the choice of salient issues at the discretion of companies.
72	
According to the research, most companies refer to and disclose policies on human rights, suggesting that many 
businesses view human rights as material. However relatively few companies disclosed relevant and specific details on 
policies. 
73	
An important finding included in the 2019 ACT report, based on the sample of 1 000 companies analysed, concerns 
disclosure on human rights due diligence. Only 22.2% of companies reported on due diligence processes and only 6.9% 
referred to their commitment to provide remedy for harmed people.
Figure 16: Disclosure on human rights due diligence
Source: An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-
Financial Reporting Directive, The Alliance for Corporate Transparency (2019) – page 19
74	
The high percentage of companies reporting on human rights policies (over 80%) is in contrast with a much lower share 
describing policy outcomes (less than 40%, and only 6.2% with respect to policy targets). The fact that only 26.4% of 
companies report data or KPIs is more difficult to evaluate given the lack of methodologies to quantify human rights 
impacts and their management.
28
28
Figure 17: Description of policy outcomes
Source: An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-
Financial Reporting Directive, The Alliance for Corporate Transparency (2019) – page 69
75	
A minority of companies address impacts on indigenous and/or local community rights across all sectors. However a 
different outcome is observed when reviewing the disclosures of companies on this topic in the Energy & Resource 
Extraction sector, where more companies refer to this issue in their reports.
76	
The relevance of reporting on high risk areas for civil and political rights depends on a company’s operational context. 
These risks are most often associated with the Energy & Resource Extraction sector. It is difficult to accurately estimate 
how many European companies operate in high-risk areas. The results provide a basic perspective on the level of 
awareness among businesses.
77	
Only a small proportion of companies referred to high risk areas for civil and political rights in their reports and to a lesser 
extend identify high risk areas as a salient human rights issue. While a larger proportion of companies in the Energy 
& Resource Extraction sector addressed this issue in their reports, results in other sectors are lower still, including 
potentially high-risk sectors such as Technology & Communications, Apparel & Textiles, and Food & Beverages.
78	
Conflict resources include conflict minerals covered by the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation – tin, tungsten, tantalum 
and gold – as well as other resources, such as timber. Technology & Communications and Resource Transformation are 
considered to be the two sectors most at risk of being linked to conflict minerals. The research behind the 2019 ACT 
report shows that most of the 1 000 companies reviewed did not cover the issue in their non-financial reporting, although 
a slightly higher number of companies in the Technology & Communications and Resource Transformation sectors 
reported on the topic.
Anti-corruption & Whistleblowing
79	
According to the 2019 ACT report, anti-corruption issues are addressed by 96.4% of the sample of 1 000 companies 
reviewed, with similar results across industries.
29
29
80	
Issues regarding whistleblowing have lower, but still significant coverage, with almost 77% of the sample of companies 
reviewed describing policies about this to some extent. 
Social matters
81	
The 2019 ACT report notes the difficulty in identifying concrete social issues that would not be classified as either a 
matter of respecting human rights or as employee-related matters as understood in the previous section.
82	
To this end, the issues examined by the 2019 ACT report under the social matters umbrella are employee & workforce 
matters and taxes.
83	
Employee & workforce matters are addressed by 98% of the sample of 1 000 companies analysed, to the degree shown 
in Figure 18 below.

Further detail, regarding specific topics of particular social relevance, can be seen in Figure 19 below, prepared using 
information from the 2019 ACT report on the sample of 1 000 companies analysed.

Significant differences can be observed when analysing these issues from an industry perspective. For instance, 
companies in Energy & Resource Extraction show significantly higher proportions on issues like trade unions and 
collective bargaining, as well as occupational health & safety, while those in Apparel & Textiles or Consumption have 
higher non-disclosure rates. Relevant differences can also be found at country level.
86	
Tax issues are also addressed very differently, as shown in Figure 20 below, prepared using information from the 2019 
ACT report on the sample of 1 000 companies analysed.

87	
The results of the research for the 2019 ACT report suggest relatively low coverage of reporting on tax-related policies 
and commitments from a country-by-country perspective. While most companies report on tax policies, only a few 
companies express specific commitment about paying taxes where profits are generated, and even fewer companies 
provide information on income taxes paid disaggregated by country.
Governance
88	
The NFRD does not explicitly require any specific governance-related disclosures even though such disclosures are 
recommended in a majority of reporting frameworks.
89	
The 2019 ACT report notes that only 14% of the sample of 1 000 companies reviewed, report that their Boards discussed 
specific issues in their non-financial reporting, and only 15% report a link between sustainability objectives and executive 
remuneration.
90	
Based on the sample of 1 000 companies analysed for the purposes of the 2019 ACT report, in terms of reporting in line 
with the NFRD:
a)	Between 40 and 50% of companies disclose a declaration of social purpose, the Board’s mandate and supportive 
procedural governance arrangements;
b)	Nearly 30% of companies disclose information on Board engagement with workforce representatives; and
31
31
c)	 About 14% of companies disclose matters that have more immediate impact on the Board’s accountability for 
sustainability performance, including compensation, independent assessment, and transparency concerning 
decisions.
Figure 21: Reporting practices

UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
91	
The 2019 ACT report concluded that although many companies espouse the Paris Agreement30 or the SDGs31, they still 
fail to set specific targets in line with them, or measure their progress accordingly. Of those who set climate targets, only 
14% align to Paris Agreement goals, for example.

Most of all, given the high level of business debate around the SDGs, the 2019 ACT report notes that with the exception 
of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain and Sweden, only a minority of companies in other EU countries make any reference 
to the SDGs in their reports across the rest of the European Union. 
93	
The Carrots & Sticks 2020 report32, which performed an analysis and high-level connections between reporting 
provisions and the SDGs, notes that the SDGs most implied by reporting provisions, directly or indirectly, are the ones 
more directly associated with business operations, e.g. SDG 12 on responsible production and consumption, SDG 16 on 
inclusive societies and accountable institutions, as well as SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth. These SDGs

are followed at significant levels by SDGs 13–15 related to climate, oceans and land, and SDGs 5–7 related to gender, 
water and energy.
94	
The Carrots & Sticks 2020 report shows that reporting provisions cover the SDGs differently, as shown in Figure 22.
Figure 22: Number of reporting provisions thematically linked to individual SDGs

goes mainstream, GRI and University of Stellenbosch Business School (2020) – page 10
95	
This breadth of reporting provisions across the different SDGs leads to a heterogeneous coverage of reporting topics 
across companies. This becomes very transparent through the findings of the 2019 ACT report, which presents an 
analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the NFRD.
96	
A study carried out by PwC in 201933, also across a sample of 1 000 company reports, found that nearly three quarters 
of the companies (72%) considered in their study publicly mentioned the SDGs in their reporting publications. Of the 
companies that mentioned the SDGs, 59% referenced them as part of their sustainability report while just over half (51%) 
mentioned them in their annual report. However, just 34% of those that mentioned the SDGs (25% of all companies 
analysed), did so in sections of their reporting that discussed business strategy. PwC found that out of the companies 
analysed, 65% mentioned specific SDGs with Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8) being the most popular goal 
identified by business (a common observation in both years when the study was carried out).
97	
The PwC study looked at how companies were focusing on the 169 targets that underpin the 17 SDGs as an indication 
of whether the goals were being integrated into business strategy. The findings indicated that only 14% (157 companies) 
mentioned specific SDG targets. Of those, 39% set qualitative ambitions and 20% set quantitative ambitions. Only 8% 
reported quantitative measures to show progress towards targets representing only 1% of all the companies analysed.
98	
WBCSD’s report ‘Reporting Matters 2019’34, noted that the vast majority (93%) of the companies in their review 
referenced specific SDGs in their report. Nearly half (43%) prioritised five to eight SDGs, with a relatively small number 
(16%) referencing 12 or more SDGs. For the fourth straight year, the most referenced SDGs were: (i) SDG 13: Climate 
action (88%), (ii) SDG 12: Sustainable cities and communities (79%), and (iii) SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth 
(73%). Those SDGs least likely to be prioritised were SDG 1: No poverty (24%), SDG 14: Life under water (24%) and SDG 
6: Peace and justice – strong institutions (29%).

99	
Overall, the WBCSD report notes little improvement in the level of detail around the SDGs from the prior year study and 
highlights:
a)	About a quarter (24%) of companies in the sample discuss target-level SDG information, with the remainder of 
disclosures focusing on goal-level information. This is up from 20% in 2019.
b)	Nearly a third reference a prioritisation process (29%) and ties to strategy (33%). About one fifth explicitly discuss ties 
between the materiality assessment process and the SDGs (24%). 
c)	 An increasing number of reports align KPIs (20% vs 6% in 2019) and targets (28% vs 15% in 2019) to the SDGs. 
d)	About a third (32%) tie SDGs to case studies or detailed evidence of sustainability programs and initiatives undertaken 
during the reporting period (19% in 2019). 
100	
As was the case in 2019, very few (1–3%) refer to enterprise risk management and human rights in relation to the SDGs.

Common topics for the extractive industries are those related to transparency of payments to foreign governments, 
human rights and conflict minerals. An example is the Act on Transparency Measures in the Mining, Oil, and Gas 
Industries (2016) by the Government of Quebec in Canada. Provisions targeting the manufacturing industries often imply 
global supply chain management, such as the Corporate Sustainability Compact for the Textile and Apparel Industry 
(2018) issued by the China National Textile and Apparel Council (CNTAC).

QUESTION 2.2:

Where is non-financial information found in companies’ publications?
102	
The NFRD provides an option for non-financial statements to be included in the annual report or in a stand-alone report 
(depending on Member States’ decisions and choices). This leads to obvious variations in presentation of non-financial 
information across companies in the EU.
103	
The examination of 145 European issuers in 2019 for the purposes of ESMA’s enforcement and regulatory activities35 
showed that 67% of the companies examined included their non-financial statements directly in the management report 
35	 Enforcement and regulatory activities of European enforcers in 2019, ESMA (2020)
34
34
(9% via cross-reference), while 14% presented their non-financial statement separately, but still within the annual financial 
report. 19% of the examined issuers presented the non-financial statement separately outside the annual financial report.
104	
The 2019 ACT report that analysed the provision of non-financial information by a sample of 1 000 companies in 
Europe, took into account any information on social and environmental issues presented in the annual report or in a 
clearly designated separate report, irrespective of whether it was formally identified by the company as a non-financial 
statement. This analysis showed that 60% of those companies integrated key non-financial information in their annual 
report.
105	
For the CDSB 2020 report ‘Falling short? Why environmental and climate-related disclosures under the EU Non-Financial 
Reporting Directive must improve’36, the CDSB reviewed the 2019 environmental and climate-related disclosures of 
Europe’s 50 largest listed companies, with a combined market capitalisation of USD 4.3 trillion. In this report the CDSB 
notes that 84% of companies used their mainstream report as the primary location of their non-financial statement. 
Approximately 10% used a separate sustainability report, with 4% preparing a standalone non-financial information 
statement in addition to their mainstream and sustainability reports. Of those that provided disclosure within the 
mainstream report, 55% integrated the content within relevant report sections (such as strategy, risk and corporate 
governance), whereas 45% included a stand-alone statement with the content presented in its own section. Those 
choosing to integrate the information adopted a ‘hybrid’ approach, where business model, due diligence and principal 
risk disclosures were integrated, but policies, outcomes and KPIs were published in a dedicated environmental or 
climate-related section of the report.
Figure 24: Primary location of non-financial statement required by the NFRD
Source: Falling short? Why environmental and climate-related disclosures under the EU 
Non-Financial Reporting Directive must improve, CDSB (2020) – page 24
106	
Regarding connectivity, the CDSB noted that many companies chose to include cross-reference tables within their 
mainstream report, sign-posting readers to the location of the specific content on ‘environmental matters’ within the 
mainstream report, and to separate disclosures where appropriate. Similarly, many disclosures included page references 
and links within and between report sections, for example linking risks to outcome disclosures, which are meant to 
support the reader in gaining an understanding of the company’s overall position, performance and approach.
107	
According to WBCSD’s report ‘Reporting Matters 2020’37 benchmarking its member companies worldwide, the relative 
percentage of stand-alone sustainability reports has dropped from 65% in 2017 to 59% in 2020, due to the increase 
in self-declared integrated/combined reports and annual reports that combine sustainability and financial information. 
WBCSD notes that its European headquartered member companies are more likely than its Asian and North American 
headquartered member companies to combine sustainability and financial information into a single report (55% 
compared with 32% and 11%, respectively).

A paper by Frank Bold published in September 201738 (hereafter ‘the Frank Bold paper’) compared the implementation 
of the NFRD in the UK, Germany, Italy and France. According to this study, only the UK and France have required the 
non-financial information statement to be included in the annual management report rather than providing the option 
allowed by the NFRD to publish as a separate report. The Frank Bold paper posited that this requirement gives gravity 
and prominence to the non-financial reporting statement, which is circulated to shareholders on a yearly basis ahead 
of the general meeting. It went further to say that this approach also improves the integration of financial and non-
financial reporting. Conversely, in Germany, if the non-financial information statement is not included in the annual 
management report, it can be published on the company’s website up to four months afterwards, provided that the 
annual management report refers to this publication and the website. The paper posited that this time lag means that 
shareholders whose attention is captured for the purposes of reviewing the annual management report and preparing 
for the annual meeting, may be lost, and non-financial information may therefore not be given the same level of attention. 
The Frank Bold paper noted that BASF (a German chemical company), Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Börse AG have all 
said that providing information in a separate report would be a step backwards.
109	
The Carrots & Sticks 2020 report39 noted that large companies are currently disclosing non-financial information in 
their annual reports, periodic reports, investor briefs, newsletters, press releases as well as web announcements and 
engagement events. The report found 165 cases explicitly referring to annual reports (or components thereof such as 
management discussion & analysis, directors’ report or governance report) and 80 cases that mention sustainability or 
non-financial reports, whilst the data collected included 175 cases where nothing was specified and 42 cases where 
specific reference is made to other data disclosures and statements. Other disclosure vehicles referred to included 
thematic reports, plans and online disclosure.

QUESTION 2.3:

Are there any reporting initiatives which provide normalised metrics, digital electronic format representation, reporting 
tools or data repository for the reporting of non-financial information?
111	
According to the European Commission’ request for technical advice from the European Lab, users have difficulty in 
finding and exploiting the reported non-financial information, in part because the information is not sufficiently digitalised. 
As a matter of fact, non-financial reporting requires not only guidelines for reporting, but also normalised metrics, digital 
electronic format representation, reporting tools and data repository solutions to enable easier disclosure, accessibility 
and analysis of non-financial information. This assessment is supported by the information presented in Table 10 below:

accessibility, and analysis of non-financial information (provided by AECA for this assessment report)
112	
Looking at the outcome of the analysis in Table 10, non-financial reporting initiatives are evolving in the following areas:
a)	Guidelines: Providing general recommendations and direction on the content to disclose, without concrete metrics, 
unit measures or methodology.
b)	Normalised metrics: Providing concrete non-financial metrics to disclose, including unit measures and methodology.
c)	 Digital electronic format: Providing a structured representation in a digital format of the non-financial information to 
disclose.
d)	Reporting platforms/tools: Providing tools to facilitate the disclosure and collection of the non-financial information.
e)	Data repository: Providing a central repository where the non-financial information from companies can be collected 
and analysed. 
113	
The only electronic format that has been promoted by non-financial reporting initiatives is XBRL (eXtensible Business 
Reporting Language). Each of the European Banking Authority (EBA)41, the European Insurance and Occupational 
Pensions Authority (EIOPA)42, the European Central Bank (ECB)43 and ESMA44, have endorsed the European Single 
Electronic format (ESEF). ESMA’s endorsement relates to issuers on EU regulated markets preparing their annual reports.
114	
SASB45, CDP46 and AECA47 support electronic formats not only to promote better data quality and analysis of the non-
financial information, but also to overcome the misalignment between the reporting of material non-financial information 
and financial reporting, in effect amplifying the concept of double materiality.
115	
In the financial reporting landscape, XBRL is already used by more than 10 million companies across 60 countries and 
implemented by 179 regulators covering the majority of public companies globally48. Figure 28 reflects the adoption 
and implementation of XBRL by capital markets for financial reporting, observing 53 instances on a global basis as of 
2020. Figure 29 extends the population to include financial regulators, business registers, tax authorities, government 
oversight, Standard Business Reporting (SBR) and others, observing 179 regulatory instances. In the maps of Figures

QUESTION 2.5:

Which type of technology framework/platform was used to provide non-financial information?
116	
The Association of Accountants and Financial Professionals in Business (IMA) published a report in 2020 entitled 
‘A digital transformation brief: Business reporting in the fourth industrial revolution’49, presenting research relevant to 
digital transformation. From the preparers’ perspective, many entities covered by the NFRD rely on manual processes, 
large teams, third-party consultants, and a variety of proprietary point solutions, such as business productivity software, 
email, and general-purpose collaboration software, to provide the requested data and disclosure. Exacerbating these 
reporting challenges is the continued growth in size and complexity of many organisations with employees and data 
located all around the world. One of the issues identified is that traditional information management solutions may not 
provide the agility, scalability and scope to economically permit a more comprehensive NFRD information management 
process. Physically connecting disparate information from internal and external data systems creates a costly information 
processing environment that is not adequate or agile enough to support both internal and external supply chain non-
financial information sources. Traditional information management solutions may not provide the agility, scalability and 
scope to economically permit this more comprehensive NFRD information management process.
117	
According to a recent report by the Transparency Market Research Group50 (a global market intelligence company), 
preparers are starting to implement cloud-based disclosure management solutions in order to publish statutory 
disclosures. The report states that disclosure management solutions are one of the steps expected to gain significant 
traction in the near future due to the rising need for managing disclosure information within organisations. Many software 
vendors are venturing into the disclosure management software market. Key players operating in the market include 
SAP, Oracle, Certent, IRIS Business Services, Workiva, CoreFiling, DataTracks, LucaNet, OCR Services, Tagetik Software, 
Synthesis Technology, Anaqua, Trintech, and Lecorpio. Accelerating digitisation has become more urgent as the COVID-
19 pandemic highlighted the inadequacies of systems that rely on outdated, insecure technology and that operate with 
vast voids of fragmented disclosure information.
118	
The abovementioned IMA study showed that physically connecting disparate information systems from internal and 
external data systems creates a costly information processing environment that may not be adequate or agile enough 
to support both internal and external supply chain information sources for non-financial information.
119	
A challenge for non-financial information data management control systems and sustainability control systems is to 
support the implementation of an integrated sustainability strategy. The configuration of an organisation’s control system 
and reporting system may vary across sustainability dimensions and type of company due to its size and activity. For 
example, it is plausible that an organisation’s environmental and financial control systems might be tightly coupled in cases 
where there is a clear association between environmental performance (e.g. energy efficiency and waste reduction) and 
cost reduction. On the other hand, it may be difficult to determine such an association with respect to social activities 
(e.g. engagement in community activities) and financial performance. Thus, there is a need for empirical evidence that 
examines these differences so reporting alone may not be enough. NFRD reporting entities are seeking management 
systems that can meet many versions of non-financial information reporting. Assessing relevant information from across 
these comprehensive strategic areas is one of the most difficult tasks for NFRD reporting teams. It requires establishing 
common definitions for critical information and potentially rethinking the association between strategy drivers and the 
underlying processes and related performance metrics. This often requires a better, more holistic approach to company 
KPIs – those that are integrated into the company’s long-term strategy for value creation across all stakeholders.
120	
Building on these requirements, there is a need for well trained professional resources within companies that are 
responsible for sourcing, aggregating and consolidating this information, with well-designed controls, processes and 
procedures that ensure that the data is reliable, timely, comparable and accurate (Figure 30).

42
121	
In fact, the entire non-financial reporting ecosystem (see Figure 30) is much more fragmented and impacts both NFRD 
companies as well as non-NFRD companies.
Figure 30: Regulatory reporting and compliance fragmented ecosystem
Source: A digital transformation brief: Business reporting in the fourth industrial revolution, IMA (2020) – page 11
122	
Considering this large ecosystem, regulated entities, governments, and regulatory authorities are increasingly 
recognising the need to discard the information processing and reporting ways of the past. They are seeing the need to 
leave behind inflexible paper-based documents or proprietary digital data formats and embrace open data standards.
QUESTION 2.6:

How many companies report through which technology framework/platform?
123	
Currently, every EU Member State has its own Officially Appointed Mechanism (OAM), which typically works as a storage 
facility that publishes statutory information related to its listed companies. Hence, any investor who wants to compare 
companies across different member states must access a different OAM for each company. Furthermore, member states 
have different national mechanisms for storing information about companies, which all work in slightly different ways, and 
the information they provide varies in terms of scope and quality.

124	
All companies, regardless of size, file reports to a national business registry in EU Member States. Different business 
registers operate within different legal frameworks, and companies need to comply with the laws of each jurisdiction. 
The national business registers validate the completeness of the filed reports and calculations and those reports are 
offered to the general public as a public database normally subject to a specific cost. It is important to note that there 
were estimated to be approximately 25.1 million SMEs in the European Union in 201851, with the vast majority being 
micro-sized enterprises which employed fewer than nine people. Only 1.47 million of those enterprises had between 10 
and 49 employees and approximately 236 thousand had 50 to 249 employers.

SECTION 3: WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES FACED FOR PRODUCING OR USING THE PROVIDED NON-
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
125	
The NFRD is the principle regulation in the EU that obliges companies to report ESG information. Applying to approximately 
6 000 large companies in the EU (listed companies, banks, insurance companies, other companies designated by 
national authorities as PIEs)52, the law requires these corporations to ‘include in the management report a non-financial 
statement containing information to the extent necessary for an understanding of the undertaking’s development, 
performance, position and impact of its activity, relating to, as a minimum, environmental, social and employee matters, 
respect for human rights, anti-corruption and bribery matters’.
126	
The NFRD gives companies significant flexibility to disclose relevant information in the way they consider most useful. 
Companies may use international, European or national guidelines to produce their non-financial statements. In June 
2017, the European Commission published guidelines on non-financial information reporting, to help companies 
disclose environmental and social information. These guidelines are not mandatory, and companies may decide to use 
international, European or national guidelines according to their own characteristics or business environment.
127	
Considering the loose definition of which information to disclose in detail, and in which format, there is a high degree 
of inconsistency in non-financial information disclosures, in respect of content and structure This creates complexity on 
the side of preparers and ambiguity for users of the disclosed information. The field of technology for disclosing non-
financial information is not yet well developed, which makes the processing and use of non-financial information difficult.
128	
The following subsections describe the key issues related to content, structure and technology in more detail, with 
reference to respective evidence from the research reports reviewed for the purposes of the assessment of Stream A6.
Content
QUESTION 3.1:

What are the issues identified with what is reported in terms of content?
129	
CDSB’s 2020 report ‘Falling short? Why environmental and climate-related disclosures under the EU Non-Financial 
Reporting Directive must improve’53, analysing the 2019 environmental and climate-related disclosures of Europe’s 50 
largest listed companies with a combined market capitalisation of USD 4.3 trillion, observes that these companies report 
data which lack quality, comparability and coherence.
130	
An article by CDP Europe54 notes that achieving the urgent transition to a resource-secure economy depends on 
companies being accountable for their impact, as well as investors and other users having usable information when 
making their capital allocation decisions. Yet the scope of the directive as it stands today falls short on both principles.
131	
The 2019 ACT report observes that about half of the 1 000 companies analysed do not generally disclose information 
useful for decision making. Approximately a third of the companies report well-developed sustainability policies, 
but these fail to provide evidence around impacts. Only 20% of the companies provide information that allows such 
understanding. This research concludes that the quality and comparability of companies’ sustainability reporting across 
the NFRD’s five topics is not sufficient for understanding their impacts, risks or plans.
132	
In October 2019, the UK’s Financial Reporting Council (FRC) issued an online consultation seeking stakeholder views and 
expectations for the future of corporate reporting. According to the published survey conclusions55, 51% of respondents 
said that they are always interested in information about how a company’s activities affect the environment, communities, 
customers and suppliers. Contrasting this, the FRC noted that existing sustainability reports rank among the least read

items in the survey. FRC’s analysis suggested that one possible explanation for this may be that survey respondents 
do not expect sustainability reports to contain information that is relevant to them in meeting their communication 
objectives. A lack of comparability and a lack of trust are among the reasons cited qualitatively by users for not engaging 
with sustainability reports more thoroughly.
133	
In summary, the evidence collected through the literature review carried out by Stream A6, regarding existing perceptions 
and issues noted by various stakeholder groups on what is reported in terms of content, highlights the following issues:
a)	Lack of conciseness in reporting;
b)	Matters affecting comparability, include: 
(i)	
Lack of common frameworks and freedom to select and combine different frameworks;
(ii)	
Differences and lack of clarity in regulatory terminology, leaving key matters such as materiality open to 
interpretation;
(iii)	
Lack of common and standardised metrics;
(iv)	 Inconsistent national implementation of the NFRD in law;
(v)	
Different levels of maturity on the topic of sustainability across the EU;
(vi)	 Proliferation of sector specific requirements; and
(vii)	 Differing levels of maturity across reporting organisations of the reporting process including responsibilities, 
systems and processes;
c)	 Lack of consistency;
d)	Lack of clarity on the definition of materiality;
e)	Inconsistent interpretation and implementation of reporting boundaries, particularly regarding supply chain aspects;
f)	 Unclear definition of component parts of the business and the value creation model;
g)	Lack of explicit requirements and methodologies for the disclosure of goals and targets as well as data to track 
progress on risks and KPIs;
h)	Lack of connectivity of non-financial information disclosed at various points in time and across different channels, as 
well as lack of connectivity with financial information;
i)	 Difficulties in measuring and disclosing impacts and a focus on inputs and outputs which are not helpful in assessing 
performance;
j)	 Reluctance to provide meaningful forward-looking information on value creation;
k)	Less forthcoming reporting of potential opportunities; and
l)	 Heterogeneous coverage of reporting topics across companies.
Conciseness
134	
A report published in 2019 by BEIS on stakeholder perceptions of non-financial reporting56 (hereafter ‘the BEIS research 
report’) concludes that corporate reporting has come under criticism in recent years for being lengthy and lacking 
focus. This trend has evolved as a reaction of corporations towards increasing regulatory requirements for disclosure,

combined with non-regulatory pressure by investors and wider society for transparency particularly regarding non-
financial information.
135	
According to WBCSD’s report ‘Reporting Matters 2019’57, benchmarking its WBCSD member companies worldwide, 
large companies increasingly try to address the needs of very different stakeholders through self-declared integrated 
reports and annual reports that combine sustainability and financial information. In its publication ‘Reporting Matters 
2020’58, the WBCSD noted that, across its 159 member companies worldwide, the average length of corporate reports 
that combine sustainability and financial information was 246 pages – the shortest report reviewed being 7 pages 
while the longest was 620 pages. The WBCSD pointed out that the length of corporate reports varied widely and 
was influenced by ownership type (private vs listed) and geography given the differing regulatory obligations across 
jurisdictions.
136	
CDSB’s 2020 report ‘Falling short? Why environmental and climate-related disclosures under the EU Non-Financial 
Reporting Directive must improve’59, analysed the 2019 environmental and climate-related disclosures of Europe’s 50 
largest listed companies with a combined market capitalisation of USD 4.3 trillion. As part of their review, CDSB looked 
at the conciseness of the disclosures and noted that on average, companies included 14 pages of environmental and 
climate-related content in their mainstream report, with a range of 1-70 pages and an average of 5% of the mainstream 
report dedicated to the topic. The longest environmental and climate related disclosure which did not include all the 
requirements of the NFRD was 14 pages; the shortest disclosure which included all the relevant content categories was 
just 2 pages. CDSB observed that the strongest disclosures, which balanced comprehensive disclosure of relevant 
environmental and climate-related information with concise reporting, were no longer than 5-10 pages. It concluded that 
whilst some organisations are choosing to produce significant disclosures under the NFRD, this demonstrates that less 
might at times indeed be more.
137	
As the ACCA 2019 report critique for the IIRC60 points out, conciseness focuses the reader’s attention on the most 
important aspects of the business by applying the materiality principle and not obscuring the significant information in a 
mass of less relevant information. Most readers want to have a succinct overall picture of the entity, at least as a starting 
point. Information on particular aspects and in greater detail could be referenced as linked reports – for example, the full 
financial statements and further non-financial information. Clearly there is a balance between keeping the report concise 
and ensuring the completeness of the information and its comparability over time or with that of other organisations.
138	
The BEIS research report notes that, investor frustrations with the reports and the value they can derive from them, tend 
to centre on their length as well as the sometimes vague and wordy nature of the information contained within them. 
Some annual reports exceed 300 pages, making them inaccessible to investors, who find it difficult to quickly identify 
information which is relevant, interesting and/or material to their decision-making. The BEIS research report also notes 
that another criticism often heard is that non-financial reporting still tends to include a lot of ‘generic marketing and public 
relations’ type content that lacks substance, whilst failing to address key strategic risks. The length of reports could be 
driven, in some instances, by a desire to appease topical single-issue lobby groups.
139	
The BEIS research report further notes there is resulting confusion around the purpose of non-financial reporting, 
which leads companies to follow a tick box approach to compliance rather than focusing on producing meaningful 
information on their value creation and performance. A lot of non-financial reports are rather limited to sustainability 
related information and mainly environmental information within that.
140	
The clearer and more focused the objectives and more specific the key stakeholders of non-financial reporting are, the 
more concise and effective the reporting will be. In practice companies are providing non-financial information through 
separate channels in an attempt to keep their annual reports streamlined whilst meeting the specific needs of a wider 
group of stakeholders.

Comparability
141	
A major area of criticism of non-financial reporting by companies across Europe is the lack of comparability. Non-financial 
reporting is criticised for being inconsistent, incomplete and difficult to compare, which impedes a robust analysis and 
decision making based on the information provided in corporate reports.
142	
This lack of comparability of reporting across the EU is mainly triggered by:
a)	a lack of a common framework and freedom of reporting entities to select and combine different frameworks to 
produce non-financial information;
b)	differences and lack of clarity in terminology used in relevant national laws and regulations, leaving things open for 
interpretation;
c)	 lack of common and standardised metrics; 
d)	inconsistent transposition and implementation of the NFRD by Member States;
e)	a proliferation of sector specific requirements; and 
f)	 differing levels of maturity across reporting organisations of the reporting process including responsibilities, systems 
and processes.
	
Lack of common framework and freedom to select and combine different frameworks
143	
Section 1 of this document makes reference to a vast number of different frameworks, standards and guidance initiatives 
currently in place. As pointed out in a discussion paper published by the FRC in October 2020 on the future of corporate 
reporting61, there is some regulation relating to non-financial reporting but there is also a multitude of voluntary 
frameworks which creates a confusing landscape for companies and results in a lack of relevant, reliable, comparable 
and balanced information for users.
144	
Although the NFRD does not prescribe a reporting framework, it encourages companies to disclose information in 
accordance with widely accepted reporting standards and frameworks, requiring companies to state which ones they 
have relied on. The European Commission non-binding guidelines on non-financial reporting62 mention frameworks 
such as the TCFD, GRI, CDP, CDSB, SASB, IIRC and the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). 
145	
In transposing the NFRD into national law, Member States have also included other national standards and frameworks, 
adding to the confusion and variety of reporting across Europe. 
146	
Furthermore, the available standards and frameworks are not mutually exclusive, and compliance with more than one of 
them is possible and increasingly common (see Section 1 of this document).
	
Differences and lack of clarity in terminology used in regulation leaving things open for interpretation
147	
The Frank Bold paper63 comparing the implementation of the NFRD in the UK, Germany, France and Italy, points out that 
there are areas where the NFRD is not clear about its intention, particularly in relation to the meaning of materiality and 
the way the business model should be reported on. Frank Bold observes that the surveyed jurisdictions have replicated 
the wording of the NFRD, failing to provide any further clarity.
148	
The same Frank Bold paper notes the NFRD’s failure to specify the scope of reporting between companies and 
jurisdictions, as well as how the non-financial information statement should reference aspects of financial reporting, with 
the surveyed jurisdictions failing to provide clarity on these points as well.

149	
For the UK, the BEIS research report on stakeholder perceptions of non-financial reporting64, points out that over half 
of the respondents that participated in the research mentioned the variations in reporting between companies and the 
consequent difficulties in comparing reports. The need for clarity or greater guidance around some of the terminology 
was also suggested by the respondents.
	
Lack of common and standardised metrics
150	
The Frank Bold paper comparing the implementation of the NFRD in the UK, Germany, France and Italy, notes that the 
NFRD fails to provide any specific KPIs that should be applied by companies, or any guidance as to what they should be 
trying to illustrate. From the countries surveyed for the Frank Bold paper only France sets out KPIs in the implementing 
legislation (such as frequency and severity of workplace accidents), while the other countries do not set out specific KPIs 
or how they should be measured. 
151	
According to the BEIS research report the multitude of KPIs used across companies makes comparative analysis very 
difficult.
	
Inconsistent implementation of the NFRD in different member states
152	
Member States have implemented the NFRD in varying ways, with different approaches on key issues, such as the 
definition of PIEs or the level of assurance required (see Section 1 for more details).
	
Differing levels of maturity across reporting organisations of the reporting process including responsibilities, 
 
systems and processes 
153	
According to a report by ECIIA ‘Non-Financial Reporting: Building trust with internal audit’65, the implementation of 
the NFRD has impacted organisations in differing ways. Some have already established reporting on non-financial 
information whereas others have not. Indeed, some may have decided not to implement the new reporting requirements 
and prefer to explain their reasons for not complying. 
154	
The ECIIA report notes that in order to fulfil their corporate social responsibility, companies should have in place a 
process to integrate social, environmental, ethical, human rights and consumer concerns into their business operations 
and core strategy, in close collaboration with their stakeholders, with the aim of: (a) maximising the creation of shared 
value for owners/shareholders, other stakeholders and society at large, and (b) identifying, preventing and mitigating 
possible adverse impact from operations.
155	
A recent series of roundtables jointly conducted by ecoDa and Mazars during 2019 and 202066, highlighted that one 
of the key challenges for a wholehearted commitment to sustainability across the business community in Europe, was 
that the focus on sustainability is often seen by many businesses as primarily a box-ticking compliance exercise, rather 
than a process for deeply embedding considerations of sustainability across all aspects of the business. It was further 
noted that the emphasis of company boards tends to be on short-term financial performance, without much attention on 
sustainability considerations at board level.
156	
According to the European Commission Summary Report of the Public Consultation on the Review of the Non-Financial 
Reporting Directive67, there is strong support for assurance for non-financial information, with 67% of respondents 
believing that the EU should impose stronger audit requirements for non-financial information. The summary goes on to 
say that some respondents stated that auditors are best placed to provide assurance on non-financial information, while 
a smaller number mentioned that this should not necessarily be the case.

Consistency 
157	
For the purposes of the Stream A6 assessment, consistency of non-financial information is considered in the context 
of applying the same frameworks and standards, and using the same approach for the same items. This should be 
the case from one reporting period to the next for a reporting entity, or in a single reporting period across different 
entities. The lack of consistency of non-financial information is currently a major issue which stems from different factors, 
including: the lack of explicit requirements for explanation of variances in the data e.g. frequent changes in the basis 
of measurement; the lack of requirements for systems, processes and controls around the collection and management 
of non-financial information; and the data still not being fully embedded in the business model. Until these issues are 
overcome, it will be difficult for management, auditors and other stakeholders to exercise a level of scrutiny over non-
financial information similar to that in place for financial information.
158	
This is further accentuated by the lack of mandatory requirements for independent assurance by regulated assurance 
providers and the ever-increasing number of reporting frameworks which mean that non-financial information disclosures 
may be subject to change from one year to the next, as a result of applying a different approach for measuring and 
disclosing data. Such changes are not in all cases fully explained in the notes, rendering the use and interpretation of 
the data rather difficult
159	
In the ACCA 2019 report critique for the IIRC68, that provides a picture of the trends and developments over a four year 
period, the authors note that consistency of the reporting over time is one area where improvement was observed in the 
reports reviewed by ACCA. Reviewers looked for performance with comparative figures and a continuity in the reporting 
of KPIs from one year to the next. ACCA highlights that this is essential for users in identifying trends in performance. 
In addition, retaining the same performance measures from one year to another helps to give readers a sense that the 
report has a balance between the reporting of good and bad news and that KPIs that have turned negative have not 
then been dropped out. ACCA concludes that consistency and comparability are both aspects that have shown an 
improving trend over the four year period of their reviews.
160	
On the other hand, a Mazars UK study of FTSE 350 disclosures of GHG emissions, published in February 2020, 
uncovered big spikes in reported emissions, suggesting unexplained volatility. Where explanations were provided, they 
were ‘not as elaborate or developed as would be expected for similar changes in profit or revenue’. The research shows 
that current disclosure of GHG emissions by listed companies is not fit-for-purpose and is in many cases a box-ticking 
exercise that does not appear to be integral to the way management runs the business.
Materiality
161	
According to the Frank Bold paper69 comparing the implementation of the NFRD in the UK, Germany, France and Italy, 
the materiality test (i.e. the test for what extent of information on each of the ESG factors needs to be provided) remains 
unclear across the surveyed jurisdictions.
162	
The Frank Bold paper notes that although the NFRD prescribes that information must be provided to the ‘extent 
necessary for an understanding of the company’s development, performance and position and the impact of its activity’, 
there has been very little information provided (in the UK, Germany, Italy and France) as to how to determine the ‘extent 
necessary’.
163	
Directive 2013/34/EU (the ‘Accounting Directive’), which the NFRD amends to include the provisions relating to the 
non-financial information statement, provides that the ‘extent necessary’ requires information to be provided ‘where 
its omission or misstatement could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that users make on the basis of the 
financial statements of the undertaking’. The Frank Bold paper notes that it is unclear who these ‘users’ or ‘readers’ might 
be. This led some of the countries in the sample addressed by the Frank Bold paper, specifically the UK and Italy, to 
taking the approach of ‘investor materiality’ rather than a wider range of stakeholders.

164	
In the case of principal risks, the NFRD states that companies ‘should provide adequate information in relation to matters 
that stand out as being most likely to bring about the materialisation of principal risks of severe impacts’, and for these 
purposes the severity of impacts should be judged by their ‘scale and gravity’.
165	
The Frank Bold paper notes that this suggests that as regards the impact of principal risks, the materiality test should be 
based on the scale and gravity of the materialisation of the risk, rather than whether knowledge of a principal risk would 
influence readers’ economic decisions (which appears to be the applicable test for materiality elsewhere in the NFRD). 
This distinction in the materiality test for ‘impact’ as opposed to other aspects of the report does not appear to be clearly 
made in the transposition of the NFRD to national law in the four jurisdictions considered for the Frank Bold paper.
166	
The Frank Bold paper further notes that the NFRD requires reporting on principal risks related to business relationships 
to be provided ‘where it is relevant and proportionate’. With the exception of Italy, this condition is included in the national 
transpositions in the jurisdictions considered for the Frank Bold paper, but no guidance is provided for its interpretation. 
167	
According to the Frank Bold paper there is also substantial uncertainty over what ‘impact’ might mean. This is particularly 
unfortunate given that the countries surveyed (UK, France, Germany and Italy) previously required companies to report 
on their development, performance and position in the context of ESG factors, but none of them required impact 
reporting. European Commission guidance says this should cover ‘positive or adverse’ impacts and that a company 
should disclose material information on principal risks ‘regardless of whether they stem from its own decisions or actions 
of from external factors’. On this basis, it can be assumed that both positive and negative impacts should be reported on.
168	
The Frank Bold paper concludes that the lack of clarity from the NFRD on materiality leads to problems, as materiality is 
one of the most fundamental aspects of reporting. Without a clear definition, companies may take significantly diverging 
approaches in relation to the extent of information that they provide, whilst complying with the broader requirements 
for reporting in general. The risk is that even if the procedural aspect of preparing a report is complied with, the more 
substantive aspect of providing useful information on ESG factors is still not guaranteed.
169	
The BEIS research report on stakeholder perceptions of non-financial reporting70 noted that materiality was a key 
concern for respondents, particularly in terms of how significant and specific the risks identified are, and in relation 
to their potential impact. Several respondents highlighted the different ways in which companies determine what is 
material and what is not, which in turn leads to a lack of comparability between company reports.
Organisational reporting boundaries
170	
Organisational boundary setting affects reporting of general sustainability and other non-financial information.
171	
A paper issued by the CDSB ‘Proposals for boundary setting in mainstream reports – Discussion paper on organizational 
boundary setting by groups of companies for non-financial reporting purposes’71 discusses the way in which a group of 
companies determines its boundaries for non-financial reporting purposes, highlighting that it is important for numerous 
reasons, including transparency, comparability and benchmarking. However, different requirements and interpretations 
exist on whether and to what extent non-financial reporting should include information about the activities of a parent 
company, its subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, investees, suppliers, upstream and downstream activities and the 
impacts of the group’s activities.
172	
The CDSB paper points out that the structure of corporate groups can change regularly, expanding and contracting with 
different priorities, opportunities and economic cycles worldwide. This affects the way in which management defines the 
boundaries of groups of companies for reporting purposes, as do other factors including legislation, voluntary protocols, 
the objectives of reporting, the placement of information, financial reporting rules, the structure of the corporate group 
and the availability of data.

Proposals for boundary setting in mainstream reports – Discussion paper on organizational boundary setting by groups of companies for non-financial 
reporting purposes, CDSB (2014)
51
51
173	
For financial reporting purposes, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) prescribe the way in which assets, 
liabilities and transactions are accounted for in relation to subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and investments 
as well as what disclosures should be made about respective interests. The CDSB paper notes that in the absence of 
an equivalent standardised approach to organisational boundary setting for non-financial corporate reporting purposes, 
it is not always clear how information prepared to comply with national legislation or under voluntary schemes, is 
‘consolidated’ into a mainstream corporate report taking into consideration all entities included in a corporate group. 
As the CDSB paper explains, this reduces the transparency, reliability and comparability of information. For example, 
performance indicators and intensity metrics become difficult to create, compare and understand where the boundary 
selected for non-financial reporting does not align with the basis on which financial or production-related information 
has been prepared. Performance results and inventory figures may also be distorted. Furthermore, lack of clarity may 
lead to double counting of information or indeed double non-accounting.
174	
The CDSB paper discusses how the concept of consolidation is firmly established in mainstream reporting practice in 
so far as the preparation of financial statements is concerned. However, the extent and how ‘consolidation’ is applied 
to non-financial reporting is less clear. The NFRD indicates that consolidation is required for non-financial reporting, 
and the content and scope of non-financial reporting seems to automatically extend the boundary of the organisation 
beyond those matters over which it has direct control and significant influence. This results from the fact that some of 
the most significant environmental and social risks and opportunities may be found outside a company’s organisational 
boundaries, in the supply chain and the environment.
175	
There is a need to reconcile non-financial reporting requirements that, by definition, extend beyond the established 
boundaries as organisations have taken different approaches to resolving this dilemma. The CDSB paper discussion 
summarises that although existing practice is varied, there is evidence of some coalescence (at least by CDSB, IIRC and 
SASB) around the view that non-financial results should be prepared according to or should be capable of reconciling 
with financial information prepared according to financial consolidation rules. This does not preclude other information 
being provided separately if it exposes the reporting organisation to risk.
176	
In the CDSB paper, it is noted that organisational boundary approaches selected by 402 of the Global 500 companies 
that responded to CDP in 2011, show that operational control is the most selected approach. Although there is no 
obvious statistical evidence of trends within sectors, 20 of the 402 companies that make up the population in the 
first table of Figure 33 are categorised as being in the utilities sector. Of those companies, six used the equity share 
approach, six financial control and six used the operational control approach, with two companies indicating that they 
used ‘other’ approaches. This would suggest an even spread of approaches amongst Global 500 utilities companies. 
The second table of Figure 33 below shows the same information from CDP disclosures for 2012. Again, operational 
control is the most used approach.

177	
The research for the 2019 ACT report across 1 000 companies who were subject to the NFRD requirements, identified that, 
whilst the NFRD asks companies to focus not only on their direct operations, but also on their supply and subcontracting 
chains …
a)	… over three-in-four of the companies assessed do not provide information about supply chain transparency in their 
reports; 
b)	… less than 1% of the companies assessed publicly list their suppliers, even in high-risk sectors;
c)	 The notable exception is the Apparel sector in which 36% of assessed companies provide at least a general description 
of the location of their supply chains, and an additional almost 14% disclose the list of the actual suppliers;
d)	In the case of GHG emissions, more than two-thirds of the companies assessed provide specific KPIs for direct 
emissions (scope 1). However, this drops to little more than half when emissions from energy use are considered 
(scope 2), and just over one-third when applied to the company’s value chain (scope 3).
178	
A scholarly article published in 2013 by A Smith ‘An Analysis of GHG Reporting Practices and their Implications for the 
Design of Reporting Programmes’, mentions unpublished research which indicated that the choice of boundary can 
change GHG emissions results by as much as 73% in one case.
53

179	
A study carried out by Oxford Brookes72 found that 72% of FTSE 100 sustainability reports adopted very narrow reporting 
boundaries, restricting the scope of responsibility or using illustrative examples to suggest wider compliance, while in 
reality providing information that could be described as ‘greenwashing’. According to the same study, other companies – 
26% of the FTSE 100 – widened the boundary of their sustainability reporting to include impacts derived from operations 
they owned, controlled or significantly influenced.
	
Supply chain
180	
The scope of data goes beyond the legal boundaries of a reporting entity. The purchase of goods and services can 
affect the impact an organisation has on society and increase its exposure to risk.
181	
The NFRD requires companies to focus not only on their direct operations, but also on their supply and subcontracting 
chains. Yet according to the research carried out for the 2019 ACT report, over three in four of the sample of 1 000 
companies analysed, do not provide information about supply chain transparency in their reports, with less than 1% 
publicly listing their suppliers, even in high-risk sectors.
182	
Obtaining accurate and reliable information from an organisation’s supply chain poses challenges around availability, 
quality and reliability. Such information from the supply chain might not always be available to a company, or not at the 
same standard as its own non-financial information.
183	
As a result, the process for producing this type of information relies on estimates and judgements. There are different 
approaches for the estimation of information not readily available from the supply chain. Each company is free to choose 
the one that works for them, something that impacts comparability. Similarly, there are no requirements for disclosure of 
the methodology used, rendering it even more difficult for users of the information to consider it in their decision-making 
process.
184	
For example, reported Scope 3 data may not always be complete and the way it is collected/arrived at can be highly 
subjective. The GHG Protocol Scope 3 Standard is the only internationally accepted method for companies to account 
for these types of value chain emissions. In a 2016 article ‘The Scope 3 Emissions Challenge’73 the author notes that 
according to some estimates74, more than 80% of the GHG impacts for most companies occur outside of their own 
operations. The article author concludes that from an environmental and business perspective, managing Scope 
3 emissions becomes crucial, and if it can be found meaningful and measurable reduction targets, then this could 
represent not only the biggest opportunity in terms of potential emission reductions, but also potential financial savings.
185	
An article published by ecoact in 201675 notes that measuring emissions in the value chain helps to identify key focus 
areas and where action needs to be taken. It also contributes to a range of business needs as well as addressing 
stakeholder demands. 
186	
Measuring Scope 1 and 2 emissions is standard practice for many large and listed companies. Research into the 
sustainability reporting performance of the FTSE 100 by ecoact76 found only one company not providing this information 
publicly. According to another factsheet by ecoact ‘Climate and the value chain: A roadmap for Scope 3 emissions 
reductions’77, in the context of stakeholder demand and the need to manage business risk, companies are increasingly 
looking to understand emissions in their value chain (Scope 3 emissions). FTSE 100 companies are already reporting 
some Scope 3 data. In many cases, these companies are reporting emissions that are easy to calculate, for example 
business travel. But these emissions may not be the most important to the business. In fact, the ecoact research showed 
that only a quarter of the FTSE 100 companies are performing materiality assessments of their Scope 3 emissions, 
suggesting that in many cases the reported Scope 3 categories may be the ones that are the most readily available, 
rather than those which are most significant within the business.

Business model / value creation model
187	
The Frank Bold paper
78 comparing the implementation of the NFRD in the UK, Germany, Italy and France, points out 
that the NFRD requires a brief description of a company’s business model to be included in its non-financial statement. 
However, it does not clarify how the description of the business model should refer to the ESG factors that the non-
financial information statement considers. There is therefore a risk that companies provide a description of their business 
model that is disconnected from the ESG matters at hand (for example the impacts of carbon risk in the forecasting of an 
energy company), thus undermining the usefulness of such reporting.
188	
The Frank Bold paper notes that, from the jurisdictions surveyed, only Italy has clarified the intention of the NFRD by 
including in its implementing legislation the requirement for a company’s description of its business model to expressly 
refer to the ESG factors that are being reported on.
189	
There is similar lack of clarity in the NFRD over the extent to which the non-financial information statement should make 
specific reference to a company’s financial information. 
190	
The abovementioned Frank Bold paper notes that each of the countries surveyed makes reference to the fact that 
the non-financial information statement should refer to, and include additional explanation of, amounts included in the 
company’s financial statements, although Germany and France qualify the need for such references on a ‘required’ 
basis. The Frank Bold paper concludes that further guidance is needed on how such references might be made, the 
level of detail they might go into, and how companies should integrate non-financial information into their forecasting, in 
order to strengthen this aspect of corporate reporting.
191	
ESMA has provided guidance on how to deal with this aspect of reporting in its Public Statement ‘European common 
enforcement priorities for 2020 annual financial reports’79. ESMA emphasises that in order to enable users of non-
financial statements to get an understanding of the business model and its relationship with and implications for the 
non-financial matters, issuers are expected to provide information about their strategy together with its implementation, 
and explain how the business model impacts on, and is being impacted by, the non-financial matters, taking into account 
their short-, medium- and long-term goals/objectives. ESMA further considers that it would be helpful if issuers were to 
disclose their definition of value creation and to explicitly mention, if relevant, the disclosure framework which provided 
this definition, and also to describe how an entity generates and preserves value through its products or services and 
provides an overview of how a company operates and the rationale of its structure by describing how it transforms 
inputs into outputs through its business activities. It also stresses that issuers are expected to highlight and explain when 
material changes to their business model and their value creation ability have taken place in the reporting year.
192	
In the 2019 report critique for the IIRC by ACCA80, that provides a picture of integrated reporting trends and developments 
over a four year period, the authors note that quality ratings for the description of the business model have been 
declining, and this is an area that the IIRC was contemplating to address in any revision of the <IR> Framework in 2020. 
They go on to note that this may be a result of the predominance of financial organisations in the sample reviewed which 
might find explaining their business model more difficult than other companies.
193	
The ACCA report above also notes that information about strategy and resource allocation is not always linked to the 
value-creation process over the shorter and longer time frames. It further mentions that ACCA carried out reporting 
reviews for their corresponding 2017 research that investigated the links of strategy and value creation over the short, 
medium and longer term and the challenges for those preparing the corporate reports. Among the issues noted 
were a focus from management on the short-term, even where a business might be investing in long-term projects. 
Also, strategy and reporting may be handled by different teams in the organisation, which does not facilitate clarity of 
reporting in this respect. Furthermore, strategy and value creation inevitably include matters of commercial sensitivity 
and of interest to competitors or regulators, which may be difficult to address by providing the right and balanced level

of detail in corporate reports. Despite such difficult aspects, the ACCA report notes that some organisations claimed that 
their reporting had evolved and improved by responding to feedback from stakeholders.
194	
For the 2019 ACT report, the assessment of the reporting of a sample of 1 000 companies has considered the 
presentation of business model disclosures both from a cross-sectoral as well as a sector specific perspective. The 
2019 ACT report notes that the cross-sectoral perspective is useful to map the issues companies consider from a 
strategic perspective, even though materiality of a sustainability issue for any company depends on the company’s 
sector and operational context. It also notes that on the other hand, the sector-specific overviews offer insights into the 
level of strategic awareness among companies of sustainability risks and impacts which are clearly associated with their 
sector. The overall results of the ACT assessment show that strategic disclosures are not common. The comparison with 
thematic results presented in various sections of the 2019 ACT report further indicate that there is a significant number of 
companies which provide information on their policies, risks, outcomes, and KPIs, but not on strategic, business model-
related information.

The diagram in Figure 34 below presents one example of the findings from the 2019 ACT report for sectors that are 
highly exposed to climate-related risks and for which reporting on these risks from a business model perspective can 
be reasonably expected to be high.

Another example, Apparel & Textiles companies and Food & Beverages companies that mostly rely on outsourced 
production located in regions with systemic human rights and natural resources abuse, including labour conditions and 
deforestation. Yet, the findings presented in Figure 35 show that only 10 30% of these companies report on these issues 
from a business-model perspective.

A third example, financial companies are connected through their investment or lending activities with all types of 
sustainability impacts. The diagram in Figure 36 shows the extent to which they consider the related risks and impacts 
strategically important for their business models.

Reporting of quantitative goals and targets as well as data to track progress
198	
There are several different definitions for the types of metrics presented by a company and used by an investor. There 
is no common nor correct way to define a number of these items, as they can vary between companies and investors, 
and even within those organisations.
199	
Performance metrics include both financial and wider metrics. Financial metrics are those that are derived based on 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (‘GAAP’), as well as those that incorporate financial information, but which are 
not the same as those measured under GAAP, e.g. adjusted EBITDA, operating earnings and free cash flows.
200	 Many non-financial metrics are expressed in non-monetary units, e.g. employee engagement results, brand awareness/
customer satisfaction scores, market share or environmental measures, which can either be standardised or company 
specific. However, due to a lack of a clear framework or defined metrics for reporting, there are a number of challenges 
both in comparing organisations with one another but also in monitoring and tracking year on year performance within 
individual organisations, as approaches to non-financial reporting can vary from one year to the next.
201	
In addition to the above, there are clear difficulties in the quantification of impacts, including the inconsistent methods for 
taking into account non-financial information stemming from an organisation’s supply chains (see section on reporting 
boundaries).
202	 The examination of the sustainability reports of the 1 000 largest companies in Europe for the 2019 ACT report, noted 
the weakness of companies in reporting quantitative goals and targets, as well as data to track progress:
a)	22% of companies presented sustainability indicators in summary form, in stark contrast to the way financial metrics 
are disclosed.
b)	14% of companies reported on how they align their climate-change targets with the Paris Agreement goals or with the 
SDGs, and measure their progress accordingly. It appears that most companies need to improve their reporting on 
targets on climate change, with specific risk mitigation strategies.
c)	 On social issues, companies in the research were too often conflating social goals with treatment of employees.
d)	Strategic information on the integration of sustainability in the governance of companies was often missed, as the 
NFRD does not explicitly require such disclosures.
e)	The clarity of reporting is often affected by the lack of homogeneity in the frameworks used, and in the presentation 
of KPIs which are often scattered across the narrative.
203	
In addition to the examination of the specificity of company climate change policies, the analysis for the 2019 ACT 
report assessed whether company reports describe concrete targets related to climate change mitigation. The analysis 
considered only targets linked to the primary impact companies can effectively mitigate. Interestingly, only 36.4% of 
companies from the Energy & Resource Extraction sector report on climate-related targets. Companies from the Financial 
sector are those disclosing climate related targets the least (20.5%), which is worrying, given the sector’s important role 
in contributing to the low-carbon transition. With regards to information on science-based targets, numbers recorded 
are even lower. From a cross-sectoral perspective, only 13.9% of companies disclose relevant data. Even in high scoring 
sectors, less than 30% of companies report relevant data (Energy & Resource Extraction sector at 23.5%).

Risks
204	
the analysis of the reporting of 1 000 companies for the 2019 ACT report showed that there is a lack of maturity especially 
for disclosure on climate-related scenarios used to inform company strategies (6.6%). In this respect, sector differences 
are striking. While 22% of companies in the Energy sector report on climate-related scenarios aligned with 1.5°C or well 
below 2°C, just over 2% in the Infrastructure provide sufficient information (2.6%). With regards to the Finance sector, 
in addition to data in the overview below, very few organisations are specific about the exposure of their lending, 
investment and underwriting activities to sectors contributing to climate change (13.4%) or provide an estimation of the 
exposure of assets (financial, non-financial, under management) or the value of collaterals to climate-related risks (3.1%).

KPIs
205	 With regards to specific metrics, the analysis of the reporting of 1 000 companies for the 2019 ACT report showed a 
relatively good image when considering the disclosures of highly polluting sectors. When looking at companies in the 
Energy & Resource Extraction, Infrastructure, Resource Transformation and Transportation sectors, Scope 1 and Scope 
2 GHG emissions are disclosed by 76.6% (87.1% in the Energy & Resource Extraction) and 60.7% respectively. Lower 
values are observed in the case of Scope 3 emissions, where an average of 35% of all companies disclose such type 
of data. Even in high-impact sectors such as Apparel & Textiles and Food & Beverages, a majority of companies do not 
provide information on Scope 3 emissions (62.7% and 71.6% respectively). Of those that do, only a small fraction report 
on emission targets. GHG intensity indicators were reported by 29.8%, 13.4% and 5% for Scope 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
206	 The CDSB 2018 review of 80 European companies’ annual reports81 found that companies have been able to disclose 
decision-useful information in line with the NFRD, however in some cases environmental targets/goals lack corresponding 
KPIs to show performance and progress towards them. 
207	
The 2019 report critique for the IIRC by ACCA82 notes that most of the concerns raised by preparers of integrated reports 
in line with the IIRC Framework, were the problems they had in measuring and quantifying the impact on the different 
capitals, especially the environmental and social outcomes of their business. At times they struggled to find indicators 
that really reflected the value-creation process and others lacked practical value. Some preparers therefore discussed 
the impacts in a qualitative way. Others were ambitious and tried not only to quantify but also to monetise the impacts. 
Some traced the issue back to the business model in showing how the organisation uses or affects the various capitals. 
208	 The IIRC Framework expects that the report should record performance and progress towards strategic objectives. 
However, in the review by ACCA for the 2019 report critique, this aspect achieved average relative scores and was 
disappointing given that the information about strategic targets and performance must be readily available and would 
be of particular interest to providers of financial capital and most other stakeholders. 
209	 In the 2019 sample of 48 reports reviewed by ACCA, only 36% provided targets for the identified KPIs in full, 43% only 
for some and 21% provided no targets for any of their KPIs.
Connectivity
210	
A 2020 EY Climate Change and Sustainability Services (CCaSS) Institutional Investor survey83, conducted on a sample of 
300 institutional investors globally, noted that among the top five challenges of investors regarding the usefulness and 
effectiveness of ESG reporting, is the disconnect between ESG reporting and mainstream financial information.
211	
The 2020 report of the European Lab Project Task Force on climate-related reporting84, that reviewed the reporting of 
approximately 150 companies from Europe and beyond, noted that the various relevant sections of companies’ reports 
are not always clearly articulated or well-connected to allow getting a complete picture of companies’ approaches 
to assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. It also noted that climate-related reporting is not 
always included in companies’ financial filings, but can often be found in other company documents. Consequently, it is 
sometimes difficult for users of corporate reports to understand how climate risks are evaluated and managed within the 
company, and who is responsible.
212	
The connectivity between financial and non-financial information is crucial. Through corporate reporting, organisations 
can communicate their individual story based on their business and value creation models. By doing so, some of the 
criticism over the ability of financial reporting to meet the needs of key stakeholders could be overcome.
213	
Bias towards quantification should be avoided, as narrative reporting is powerful and can provide relevant information 
and insights beyond the numerical facts.

214	
Certainly, online and digital reporting platforms have the potential to link non-financial reports to other reports and 
provide cross-references between different parts. Technology can get ahead of regulation, which in some cases restricts 
the formats in which reporting can be done.
215	
The CDSB 2018 review of 80 European companies’ annual reports85 found that companies have been able to disclose 
decision-useful information in line with the NFRD, however:
a)	Many do not make the connection between the information disclosed. For example, a report may describe 
environmental policies, without explaining the company’s strategies to implement them;
b)	Coherent and connected reporting demonstrates the relationships between vision, mission, risks, policies, strategies, 
targets and KPIs. Reporting however is not always easy to navigate, read and search. This is important to aid user 
understanding.
216	
Connectivity seems to be a principle with which some companies struggle. The 2019 report critique for the IIRC by 
ACCA86 notes that some users seem to interpret the IIRC Framework as specifically the interconnection between the 
different capitals and how investment and good performance for one may positively or negatively affect others.
217	
The IIRC Framework states the objective of connectivity as follows: ‘An integrated report should show a holistic picture of 
the combination, interrelatedness and dependencies between the factors that affect the organisation’s ability to create 
value over time’. It considers that there should be connectivity in different forms, including between: content elements, 
the past, present and future, the six capitals, financial and other information, quantitative and qualitative information, 
information for management and that reported externally. There may be a disconnect between non-financial indicators 
and financial ones because of time lags between them. In the same way, output measures may be ahead of outcome 
measures.
218	
The issue of connectivity was also highlighted by respondents to the research on stakeholder perceptions of non-
financial reporting conducted by BEIS in 201987. Below are some relevant comments from respondents to this research:
a)	‘There is a glaring disconnect between trends and risks discussed in the strategic report and key accounting 
assumptions and estimates used in the accounts themselves.’ ClientEarth
b)	A respondent highlighted the number of reports required, from a strategic report through to a directors’ report, which 
means that reporting can get quite silo-ed. 
c)	 ‘There are lots of different pieces which, either through tradition, legislation or regulation have to be disclosed 
somewhere. However, it doesn’t lead to a document which has a natural start, middle and end, which people can see 
and be told the story. It becomes quite broken up and I think that the legislation has made this worse rather than made 
it better.’ Companies Alliance
Reporting impacts
219	
According to the 2019 ACT report that analysed the reporting of a sample of 1 000 companies, the NFRD’s firm intent 
to link ‘policies, risks and results’ together in the reporting, is falling short, with most reporting entities disclosing inputs 
rather than outcomes. The absence of ‘impact’ in the reporting demands urgent attention both in reporting companies 
and in the revision of the NFRD itself.
220	 The 2019 ACT report notes that this issue is further accentuated by the fact the companies continue to use non-financial 
reporting as a means of marketing and providing ‘boiler plate’ disclosures that do not mean much.
221	
On climate change, 82% of companies have policies, but only 35% have targets and even fewer – 28% – report on their 
outcome.

222	
Despite the controversies about data privacy and cyber security, 84% of ICT companies report data protection policies, 
but only 8% describe outcomes in terms of meeting policy targets.
223	
Even where there are targets, this does not mean they are meaningful. The major extractives company in the sample 
analysed for the 2019 ACT report, that sets its objective as ‘the wellbeing of our people, the community and the 
environment is considered in everything that we do,’ discloses ‘warm words’ rather than concrete targets, which are 
espoused in too much of today’s reporting.
224	
The 2019 ACT report further notes that the problem of a failure to address concrete issues, targets and principal risks, 
remains largely unchanged between the 2018 and 2019 research cycles carried out by the Alliance for Corporate 
Transparency.
225	
Of the 105 companies in the Energy, ICT and Health Care sectors analysed in both years, there was actually a reduction 
in the number of companies reporting specific issues and targets on climate change, a similar decrease in the number of 
business partners covered by human rights risk statements and a marked increase in companies that chose to give no 
information at all about the general structure and risks of their supply chain (from 51 to 70 companies).
226	
Data on universally or nearly universally applicable topics, namely climate change, employee and social matters, human 
rights, and anti-corruption, show that only a minority of companies provide information specific enough to understand 
company policies. This minority is stronger regarding climate change and employee matter disclosures (34.5% and 
43.1% respectively), than for human rights (21.9%) and anti-corruption (19.7%). These numbers drop, especially for climate 
change, in the analysis of quality of disclosure of risks as well as policy outcomes in terms of targets set by the company. 
227	
As the 2019 ACT report points out, this suggests firstly that while many companies, albeit still a minority, disclose fairly 
detailed policies, significantly fewer companies provide information which is necessary to understand their situation and 
future development. The analysis of detailed qualitative criteria in the 2019 ACT report shows that the actual number of 
meaningful disclosures is even lower. 
228	
Secondly, the 2019 ACT report notes that for each category the number of companies reporting on individual sustainability 
issues is significantly higher than that of companies providing specific information on risks and implementations of their 
policies. This implies that the topic is either not material, and thus should ideally not be included in the disclosure of such 
companies, or that it is indeed material, but companies fail to provide material information. 
229	
Thirdly, always according to the 2019 ACT report, the results imply poor connectivity between the disclosures of individual 
categories of information. The detailed analysis in the 2019 ACT report confirms such a problem, and further points at 
weaknesses in how companies report on the integration of non-financial information with their overall strategies.

Positive impacts by products and services and sources of opportunity
230	 According to the 2019 ACT report, based on the sample of 1 000 analysed, there is a gap between the proportion of 
companies reporting on strategies and initiatives for climate change, other environmental issues and social/ community 
matters (33.8%, 30.7% and 26.8% respectively), and those disclosing relevant and decision-useful information around 
such strategies. This is the case when looking at corporate disclosure on the turnover from products or services 
addressing sustainability challenges for these matters (5.8%, 4.9% and 3% respectively), and data on investment in 
the associated described strategies (9.4%, 7.2% and 7.9% respectively). Reporting on this is key if companies are to be 
transparent and provide investors with information about the sustainable activities they engage in, in line with the (future) 
requirements of the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities.

services that focus on sustainable development opportunities

Long-term value creation
231	
To be of value, corporate data must show companies’ long-term value creation. The outlook facing the business and the 
challenges and uncertainties likely to arise in pursuing its strategy are of great interest to stakeholders. This is an area 
where reports could be improved.
232	
A report by PwC in 2016 ‘A foot in the past and an eye to the future’88, addresses the importance of forward-looking 
information in company reporting and presents trends and practices based on the review of the 2015 reporting of 52 
FTSE 350 companies. This report highlights that a reluctance to provide meaningful forward-looking information is 
88	 A foot in the past and an eye to the future, PwC (2016)
64
64
evident in different forms of corporate reporting and could reflect a natural caution by management or legal or regulatory 
restrictions.
233	
A 2018 report by EY ‘Does your nonfinancial reporting tell your value creation story?’89 notes that investors seek more 
forward-looking information and closer connections between ESG activities and business. The EY report quotes an 
investor saying ‘it’s one thing for a company to report its ESG achievements over the past 6 months, 12 months, or 3 to 5 
years, but we’d like to see what that will look like 20 or 30 years in the future’.
234	
The Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism and EY brought together 31 companies, asset managers and asset owners, to 
identify new metrics to measure and articulate long-term value to investors and other stakeholders – the Embankment 
Project for Inclusive Capitalism (EPIC). EPIC published a report in 201890. This report stresses that for a company to 
effectively measure and articulate its long-term value creation potential, a framework is necessary that combines a 
broader view on value creation beyond financials, with a broader stakeholder perspective and long-term orientation. It 
also states that although many of the existing frameworks may cover one or two of these aspects across a defined field, 
such as human or natural capital, none of them are sufficiently comprehensive.
235	
The 2019 report critique for the IIRC by ACCA91 highlights that during their 2018 reviews they explored with some 
preparers the management’s perception of the outlook facing the business and what challenges and uncertainties are 
likely to arise in pursuing its strategy. It notes, that most interviewed preparers argued that although liability concerns 
should not hold back reporting of future prospects, there is concern that by discussing possible actions, reporting 
entities may be seen as committed to them and that the discussion should avoid any cases where talking about risk 
situations might heighten their likelihood. It also notes that some companies might find discussing the outlook in their 
integrated report easier than others, because they must produce a forward plan for their regulator.
Exposure to risks
236	
To be of value, corporate data must show companies’ exposure to risks. As the regulatory framework of the European 
Green Deal92 comes into play, companies will face higher regulatory risks if they do not reduce their environmental 
impact. The NFRD should call for more accurate and comprehensive reporting of risks and opportunities linked to 
climate, the environment and social aspects.
237	
The 2019 report critique for the IIRC by ACCA concluded that in order to understand strategy, performance and 
prospects, it is crucial that an integrated report assesses the risks to which the organisation is exposed. This comes 
out as an area of relative strength in reports reviewed by ACCA over a period of four years, identifying the risks that 
could affect value creation over the shorter and longer term and how the company was mitigating them. Companies 
have got more accustomed over recent years to discussing risks, not only via the IIRC framework but also as required 
by regulation or accounting standards. On the other hand, some reports were less forthcoming about the opportunities 
that also presented themselves. This seems aligned with the requirements of investors and other providers of financial 
capital, who often seem more interested in understanding risks than perceived opportunities. In addition, opportunities 
may have more commercial sensitivity.
238	
The abovementioned ACCA report notes that in the interviews they carried out for the 2018 reviews, as regards 
opportunities, some of the preparing companies cited both less investor interest in them and commercial competitive 
concerns. There were also issues about overpromising investors about the potential of opportunities. These companies 
claimed that readers expected some degree of prudence and restraint and that this aided credibility. Some banks, for 
example, assessed and reported risk and opportunities together when discussing the different issues faced by the 
business.

In line with NFRD provisions, companies must currently disclose information on four non-financial matters: environment, 
social and employment, human rights, and corruption and bribery.

241	
This breadth of reporting provisions across the different SDGs leads to a heterogeneous coverage of reporting topics 
across companies. This is validated through the findings of the 2019 ACT report which presents an analysis of the 
sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the NFRD – information in this respect is included in Section 2 of 
this assessment report.

The Carrots & Sticks 2020 report shows the diversity of reporting formats, and summarises the situation as follows:
Quote 1
‘Our 2020 stock-take looked in greater detail at disclosure venues and concluded that the variety of forms is 
too diverse to give a reliable conclusion on trends. While we found 165 cases explicitly refer to annual reports 
(or components thereof such as management discussion & analysis, directors’ report or governance report) 
and 80 cases that mention sustainability or non-financial reports, our latest data also includes 175 cases where 
nothing is specified and 42 cases where specific reference is made to data disclosures and statements.
Other disclosure vehicles referred to include thematic reports, plans and online disclosure. The diverse nature of these 
specifications possibly calls for some standardization, for example consideration by regulators of what specifications 
are most effective and efficient in the digital age. Greater interest in data and the format in which data is communicated 
need to address ongoing concerns related to the reliability, comparability and timeframe of data disclosed. Reporting 
format or type also need to consider the specific user audience addressed and their information needs.’

Ultimately, the Carrots & Sticks 2020 report concludes that ‘it is unclear whether recommendation of disclosure venue 
by regulators effectively consider the user target audience’.

The 2017 Frank Bold paper94 comparing the implementation of the NFRD in the UK, Germany, Italy and France, concludes 
as follows:
Quote 2
‘Of the four jurisdictions considered in this paper (UK, France, Germany and Italy), only the UK and France have gone 
beyond the requirements of the Directive to require the non-financial information statement to be included in the annual 
management report (rather than either being included in the annual management report, or being prepared as a 
separate report). The requirement for inclusion in the annual management report gives gravity and prominence to the 
non-financial reporting statement, which is circulated to shareholders on a yearly basis ahead of the general meeting. 
This also improves the integration of financial and non-financial reporting which can be seen as a positive step.
Conversely, in Germany, if the non-financial information statement is not included in the annual management report, 
it can be published on the company’s website up to four months afterwards, provided that the annual management 
report refers to this publication and the website. This time lag means that a number of shareholders whose attention is 
captured for the purposes of reviewing the annual management report and preparing for the annual meeting, may be 
lost, and that the information will therefore not be given the same level of attention. BASF (a German chemical company), 
Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Börse AG have all said that providing information in a separate report is a step backwards.’

A survey conducted by EY on a sample of 300 institutional investors globally95 highlights some of the challenges in non-
financial reporting and includes the disconnect between ESG reporting and mainstream financial information as one of 
the top five issues affecting the usefulness and effectiveness of ESG reporting. 
247	
The TCFD recommendations ask for disclosures to be made in financial filings, alongside other financial disclosures. 
According to the EY Global Climate Risk Disclosure Barometer96, this element of the TCFD recommendations is yet to 
be widely implemented. Some companies did include relevant climate-related disclosures within the annual report as 
part of a discussion on the business strategy in the directors’ report or within the operating and financial review (which 
includes a description of the future prospects of the business). However, the overwhelming majority provided relevant 
climate-related disclosures within separate non-financial reports, sustainability reports or their Carbon Disclosure 
Project (CDP) reporting. EY notes that despite the call in the TCFD recommendations, there are several reasons why 
most companies have not taken the step to include disclosures in their annual reports or directors’ reports. The relative 
immaturity of processes to capture and report on climate change risks is likely to be one reason, as well as the difficulty 
in setting timeframes on the potential implications of either transition or physical climate-related risks. It can also be 
difficult to translate these risks into financial implications. However, shareholder resolutions, enforcement of listing rules 
and regulator focus is likely to force companies to change this in upcoming reporting periods.

QUESTION 3.3:

What are the issues identified in respect of the means through which non-financial information is reported?
248	
The non-financial reporting ecosystem is fragmented at various levels and variables, including data formats, modes of 
submission, data definitions for certain common elements, business rules, access controls, and validations for similar 
reporting elements across different forms and regulators.

Government agencies and regulatory authorities are under increasing pressure to reduce the costs of compliance, both 
to create economic conditions for business growth and capital allocation and to reduce operating expenses that are 
typically funded by treasury departments that must do more with less.
250	 According to the OECD Regulatory Compliance Cost Assessment Guidance97, compliance costs are incurred by both 
regulatory authorities and regulated entities. Regulatory authorities incur costs for publishing, administering, monitoring, 
and enforcing regulations, including the costs of:
a)	Developing and implementing licensing or registration systems;
b)	Assessing and approving applications;
c)	 Processing renewals;
d)	Implementing inspection or auditing systems; and
e)	Implementing systems for sanctions for noncompliance.
251	
The fragmentation regarding technology is classified under six headings below. The information provided is sourced 
from the report published by IMA in 2020 entitled ‘A digital transformation brief: Business reporting in the fourth industrial 
revolution’98 and supporting research.
Non-financial data processes
252	
The flows and interfaces between input, throughput, and output across various systems are not aligned and often 
require manual intervention to ensure that the output of one system is reprocessed in the necessary format to be 
validated for submission to the next system. It is further connected to multiple output reports, where the need to ensure 
a single source of truth is essential. For example, the data from a regulated entity’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) 
software needs to be compiled and repackaged in order to meet a regulator’s ‘form’ and ‘data format’ requirements for 
filing submissions. Seamless integration between these internal and external interfaces depends on codified standards 
for data generation, validation, and sharing.
Data types
253	
This is the most common area of fragmentation. Data held in an ERP system consists of one type, which often must be 
converted into a different type in order to be transmitted into another system. Different regulators require the same 
information in their specific formats or data types. Surprisingly, some individual regulators call for the same information in 
different forms and in different data formats. The assembling, dismantling, and repackaging of data in the required format 
can cause compliance issues and unintentional information errors when filing. Adoption of common codified standards 
for machine-readable data creation and exchange across all stakeholders within the compliance ecosystem could result 
in a giant leap toward coherence in the data flow.
Standards and supporting documents
254	
Regulators adopt unique standards, data definitions, and business validation rules for similar non-financial data elements 
and metrics. A lack of cohesion in standards across regulators results in higher entity and regulatory costs in terms of 
time and resources. It also weakens auditability of information disseminated to a multitude of regulators and increases 
risks due to increased subjectivity, differences in interpretations, misinformation, and inadvertent partial compliance or 
non-compliance.
Technical standards
255	
Different regulators have different access controls, validation rules, and data format specifications. These differences 
increase the complexity within a compliance ecosystem.

Submission modes
256	
The modes of regulatory information submission differ for different forms and types of information. This creates additional 
hurdles both in creating standardised last-mile reporting validation rules and in creating seamless integration across 
internal and external systems.
Data definitions
257	
Data definition fragmentation is more prevalent when reporting the same information to multiple regulators. The 
fragmentation occurs from the lack of clarity in communication and the lack of a single set of standards and definitions 
across multiple regulators. It is not uncommon to find differences in interpretation of the definition of various data 
elements among regulators. This naturally lends itself to an increased risk of misstatement and miscommunication and a 
corresponding increase in regulated entities’ compliance costs for having to maintain multiple variants of the same data 
items (from entities having to validate each time they submit to the various regulators).
SECTION 4: WHAT IS THE SPECIFIC SITUATION OF SMEs RELATED TO NON-FINANCIAL REPORTING?
258	
According to the European Investment Bank Group99, SMEs represent 99.8% of all businesses in the EU.
259	
SMEs are defined in the EU recommendation 2003/361100. The main factors determining whether an enterprise is an SME 
are staff headcount and either turnover or balance sheet total:
Table 11: SME definition in EU recommendation 2003/361
COMPANY CATEGORY
STAFF HEADCOUNT
TURNOVER
BALANCE SHEET TOTAL
Medium
< 250
≤ EUR 50 million
≤ EUR 43 million
Small
< 50
≤ EUR 10 million
≤ EUR 10 million
Micro
< 10
≤ EUR 2 million
≤ EUR 2 million
Source: EU recommendation 2003/361
260	 These ceilings apply to the figures for individual enterprises only. An enterprise that is part of a larger group may need 
to also take into account staff headcount, turnover and balance sheet data relating to that group.
261	
The assessment of non-financial reporting by SMEs needs to take into consideration that the world of SMEs’ non-
financial reporting is under-researched (which companies report, what they report, and what the information needs of 
the stakeholders are). The reasons for this lack of research are diverse: First, there is a lack of interest for and knowledge 
of the SME world amongst academics and researchers. Second, in particular regarding non-financial reporting, SMEs 
usually disclose on a voluntary basis or in an informal way, which leads to a lack of consistent data for possible research 
in this respect.

Regulatory/ voluntary context
QUESTION 4.1:

On what basis do SMEs report? Do they report to meet regulatory requirements, other mandatory obligations or on a 
voluntary basis? What are the relevant rules?
QUESTION 4.2:

How many SMEs report to meet regulatory requirements or other mandatory obligations on a voluntary basis?
262	
The number of SMEs that disclose non-financial information due to the trickle-down effect or on a voluntary basis is not 
known, nor is what they disclose and how they disclose it. 
263	
In a March 2017 report, the European Federation of Accountants and Auditors for SMEs (EFAA) analysed the trickle-down 
effect in financial reporting101. This survey covered Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the UK. Preparers 
were asked to identify and provide details of the application (or not) to SMEs of what were judged the main (not all) 
accounting treatments in full IFRS. 
264	
The EFAA report concludes ‘that the impact of ‘trickle down’ is significant in all five countries. In all cases, convergence 
(…) of SME accounting with IFRS is at least 57% and the countries fall into a relatively narrow range of between 57% 
for Germany and the Netherlands, and 72% for the UK. All show clear signs that ‘trickle down’ has been a major factor 
in producing that convergence (ranging from 33% in the Netherlands to 59% in Portugal). It should be noted that 
distinguishing whether a current treatment derived from IFRS or from pre-existing practice can be a difficult matter to 
judge, in some cases. Difference in country ranges arise from specific actions taken by individual countries.
265	
It is also observed that the extent of ‘trickle down’ is clearly greater for larger SMEs.
Figure 43: Extent of financial reporting standards trickle-down for SMEs
Source: The Trickle Down Effect – IFRS and accounting by SMEs, EFAA (2017) – page 5
266	 The EFAA report further concludes ‘Having concluded that the largest SMEs were most likely to have ‘trickle down’, a 
more detailed analysis of the medium-sized entities was carried out to ascertain what other conclusions might be drawn. 
The following factors were noted:
a)	More ‘trickle down’ is likely in areas where the Accounting Directive is silent, because national GAAP will tend to use 
IFRS where that is so (…)
101	 The Trickle Down Effect – IFRS and accounting by SMEs, EFAA (2017)
71
71
b)	Less ‘trickle down’ will be seen in more complex matters, such as financial instruments and complex group structures.
c)	 Mixed impact is noted because some countries, for example Germany, have avoided implementing fair value principles 
in most instances.
d)	In summary there is significant evidence of ‘trickle down’ and this increases with the size of the entity.’
267	
Based on the EFAA report on financial reporting, it is fair to assume that non-financial reporting obligations towards large 
entities will also lead to a trickle-down effect for non-financial aspects. Such trickle-down effect is already visible today 
via the process of large entities asking their suppliers to provide non-financial information and to get such information 
validated by rating agencies (e.g. Ecovadis). However, this trickle-down effect would certainly be a less coordinated one 
compared to proper regulatory requirements for non-financial reporting towards SMEs.
Location
QUESTION 4.3:

Where is non-financial information found in SMEs’ publications?
268	
Although there is no legal obligation deriving from the NFRD for SMEs to disclose non-financial information, many of 
them are under increasing pressure from their parent companies to provide certain non-financial information in order 
to meet group reporting obligations. Key stakeholders such as corporate clients that are introducing sustainability and 
transparency requirements in their supply chain, are also exercising pressure in this field (see also section above about 
the trickle-down effect). Those SMEs that cannot meet such requests due to insufficient human and financial resources, 
are penalised in terms of market access. Furthermore, with the increase in requests for non-financial information from 
investors or other finance providers, linked to new regulatory obligations, these SMEs could be denied access to finance.
269	
Information reported by SMEs is often scattered across various documents, some of which are not accessible to the 
public. SMEs do not use the reporting tools used and developed for big corporations. SMEs work in a more informal 
way, while the existing non-financial information tools rather follow formal practices which require investment in time, 
resources and energy that SMEs cannot afford.
Classification
QUESTION 4.4:

What are the topics the most reported upon and by what types of entities?
270	
No information was traced as readily available to indicate the non-financial information topics most reported upon by 
SMEs. 
271	
The question arises whether additional disclosure of non-financial information adds value for the stakeholders of every 
SME. In addition, depending on the type of SME one could argue that the value of additional information does not 
necessarily outweigh the costs. Examples are family-owned companies with closely involved shareholders. Those 
shareholders are aware of the purpose of the company and do not have to rely on non-financial information reporting to 
gain insights due to family involvement.
272	
The size of an SME influences the reporting possibilities and capacities of that SME in terms of time, cost and from a 
technical perspective. Subsequently, the size and transparency of the suppliers of the SME influences the possibilities 
to obtain and provide information by the SME on specific topics.
72
72
273	
The most significant and salient observations and assessment points of Stream A6 are identified and described below, 
including articulation of their relevance and importance in the perspective of possible non-financial standard setting.
274	
The large and increasing number of reporting requirements and frameworks, together with their heterogeneity (in 
scope, objective, implementation – voluntary or mandatory, technology, etc), are a source of numerous inconsistencies 
in reporting practices, ultimately failing to address users’ needs while being a burden for preparers of non-financial 
information, whose specificities and capacities (from large companies to SMEs) are not sufficiently considered.
275	
Despite their increasing number, reporting provisions pursuing different objectives for different users fail to provide 
consistent guidance about what information to report (scope, breadth, depth), how and where. In this context of high 
complexity, companies are unsure whether they provide non-financial information that would be considered of good 
quality by users while at the same time being relevant to their main impacts, risks or policies. Users, on the other hand, 
struggle to locate and sometimes make sense of the reported data. This situation is further complicated by the lack of 
uniform requirements for monitoring of compliance and independent verification of the data.
276	
Mirroring the fast-growing number and diversity of reporting provisions, non-financial disclosures have significantly 
increased in a somewhat unfocused manner. An increasing amount of non-financial data is disclosed in a variety 
of different places outside of the annual report or sustainability report via external links and complementary online 
content (investor briefs, press releases, newsletters, websites, etc). This makes it difficult for users to find decision-
useful information and introduces uncertainty about whether the provided information is different between the different 
formats. The diversity of disclosure formats also makes it difficult for users to assess the relevance, comparability and 
reliability of the disclosed information.
277	
The focus and momentum on environmental related matters both at policy level and in reporting frameworks is reflected 
in the efforts and focus put on reporting about climate or other environmental issues. In comparison, information given 
about other topics of interest to users seem to be less developed and elaborate.
278	
Different reporting provisions put different emphasis on reporting of actual data compared to providing information on 
progress over time, on outcomes and impact, and/or on providing a forward-looking perspective. Existing provisions 
appear to rather focus on documentation and reporting per se, instead of driving real action. Consequently, reporting 
entities’ efforts tend to be directed at describing policies rather than focusing on the impacts of such policies and 
highlighting the link between risks, policies and impacts. Although reporting increasingly includes references to the 
Paris Agreement or global policy priorities the extent of reporting specific targets to measure progress is limited (e.g. 
failure to report on targets on climate change, and measurement of actions to manage human right risks). This may be 
explained by challenges in the quantification of some of the topics (especially social issues), the lack of standardised 
metrics and the lack of maturity in the systems and processes which support the generation of this information.
279	
Non-financial reporting provisions currently tend to focus on large and listed companies, meaning that some users’ 
needs are not met. In this regard, the situation of SMEs that are part of the supply and value chain of companies subject 
to mandatory non-financial reporting is a challenging one. Existing reporting requirements have not been tailored to 
consider their limited resources and capacities, making their contribution to the overall non-financial reporting objectives 
a source of problems both for them and for the multitude of stakeholders that wish to use their data and information. 
Specific consideration on how to include SMEs in the non-financial reporting landscape at a reasonable cost and effort 
for them appears to be missing. 
280	 Beyond SMEs, preparers of all sizes are pointing at the difficulty of finding the right balance between satisfying the 
needs of a broad universe of users (having very different perspectives, expectations and therefore needs) and their 
own reporting needs, while keeping reporting costs at a reasonable level. In addition, while asking for clarification about 
SALIENT ASSESSMENT POINTS
73
73
a non-financial reporting target structure, all preparers are also expressing the need for a proportionate approach to a 
staged implementation based on a proper cost/benefit analysis.
281	
From a digitisation perspective, the non-financial reporting ecosystem is diversified in many ways, inflating costs, 
creating operational and compliance risks, and ultimately hampering access:
a)	Regulators apply their own standards, data definitions (if any) and validation rules for similar non-financial data 
elements and metrics. In the EU currently there is no digital taxonomy of non-financial data allowing for efficient and 
consistent access to such non-financial data (except for Spain, although even the Spanish taxonomy is used little in 
practice).
b)	The lack of cohesion in standards and (digital) taxonomy, results in higher entity and regulatory costs in terms of 
time and resources. It also weakens the auditability of information and increases risks due to increased subjectivity, 
differences in interpretations, misinformation, and inadvertent partial compliance or non-compliance. Also, the 
assembling, dismantling, and repackaging of data in the required format can cause compliance issues and unintentional 
information errors when filing.
c)	 Same inconsistencies and insufficiencies apply to access controls, validation rules and data format specifications. 
These differences and gaps increase the complexity and challenge the usefulness of a compliance ecosystem.
d)	The flows and interfaces between input, throughput and output across various systems are not aligned and often 
require manual intervention to ensure that the output of one system is reprocessed in the necessary format to be 
validated for submission to the next system.
e)	Modes of information submission differ for different forms and types of information.
