The European Lab Steering Group Chair has assessed that appropriate quality control and due process had been observed to the extent possible within the context of the relevant mandate and the timeframe allowed, and has approved the publication of the PTF-NFRS report and its appendices. The PTF-NFRS report and its appendices do not represent the official views of EFRAG and are not subject to approval by the EFRAG governance bodies: EFRAG General Assembly and the EFRAG Board; or the European Lab Steering Group.As regards the views expressed in the PTF-NFRS report and its appendices the following observations and clarifications should be noted:\u2022 the PTF-NFRS report taken as a whole reflects a very large consensus;\u2022 it is understood that members of the PTF-NFRS are not expected to endorse each and every one of the 54 detailed proposals in the PTF-NFRS report and may have different views on some of them;\u2022 in addition the views expressed may not reflect the views of the organisations or entities to which individual PTF-NFRS members may belong;\u2022 the assessment work for the different project focus areas, presented in Appendices 4.1 to 4.6 to the PTF-NFRS report, was the result of separate sub-groups of the PTF-NFRS, for which only peer review within the PTF-NFRS was performed.Links are included in the PTF-NFRS report and its appendices to facilitate readers accessing the reference or source material mentioned.

The analysis took the form of desktop research that involved reviews of published research and data analysis.Stream A6 observes that the large and increasing number of reporting requirements and frameworks, together with their heterogeneity (in scope, objective, implementation \u2013 voluntary or mandatory, technology, etc.), are a source of numerous inconsistencies in reporting practices. The assessment of Stream A6 is that these ultimately fail to address users\u2019 needs while being a burden for preparers of non-financial information, whose specificities and capacities (from large companies to SMEs) are not sufficiently considered.Stream A6 finds that from a digitisation perspective, the non-financial reporting ecosystem is diversified in many ways, inflating costs, creating operational and compliance risks, and ultimately hampering access.",

Any such standard setting has three dimensionsContent: What is disclosed? How is it disclosed?Classification: Where is the information located? Does the required information have an address / taxonomy of data?Reporting format: How is the information reported?ScopeStream A6 assessed the current situation of non-financial reporting for each of the three dimensions mentioned above.The analysis focused primarily on the reporting practices followed by EU companies under the scope of the NFRD. The analysis mostly took the form of desktop research, based on reviews of published research and data analysis.ObjectivesStream A6 sought to evaluate the following questions:a) How is non-financial information produced? The evaluation focused on:Regulatory and/or voluntary context On what basis do companies report? Do they report to meet regulatory requirements, other mandatory obligations or on a voluntary basis? What are the relevant rules? What are the trickle-down effects of mandatory reporting requirements applicable for large entities, into disclosure requests towards SMEs along the supply chain? Is external assurance required, and if so, which level?Company reportingHow many companies and which companies report? Under which context, in which sectors and of which size? Is there uniform reporting across industries/countries?Frameworks, standards and guidanceWhat are the frameworks, standards and guidance most frequently used to produce non-financial information and by what type of companies? Do companies use single or multiple references to fit their needs?b) How is non-financial information provided? This question focused on:How is the information classified? Is a specific taxonomy applied?FormatHow is the information reported? Do companies use special platforms, websites, registration document filings or other formats?LocationWhere is non-financial information found in companies\u2019 publications (combined management report with financial report, separate sustainability report, registration documents, elsewhere\u2026)?TechnologyWhat kind of technology is used to provide non-financial information? What is the progress of digitisation in non-financial reporting? Does digitisation play an important role?Additional comment: Digitisation is a way of submitting content. How to improve and expand its use is an essential consideration for improvement of non-financial reporting, but the pressing need is about format: Where does the digitised content go? How was it produced? Is it verifiable?c) What challenges are faced when producing or using the provided non-financial information, both from a preparer and a user perspective with focus on:Content: What are the issues faced with what is reported? Structure: How is non-financial information reported?Technology: What are the means used to report non-financial information?ApproachStream A6 conducted its assessment through a desktop review of relevant publicly available literature and data analysis. As such, most statements in this assessment report reflect the content of this literature and data analysis. These statements are synthesised and summarised into salient observations, for the Stream A6 own assessment and conclusion.The full list of documents reviewed is provided in the Appendix to this assessment report. The most relevant sources for the information included in this assessment report were the following:An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-Financial Reporting DirectiveAlliance for Corporate Transparency (2019).

This could reflect the increased demands in recent years from investors and other stakeholders for disclosure around climate risk, whether due to mandatory requirements or voluntary reporting initiatives. Climate risk has been a focus of established reporting standards, frameworks and principles including GRI, CDP and CDSB, as well as the NFRD. Disclosure on waste is the second most frequent topic, but with varying levels of disclosure provided, as shown later in paragraph 66.The 2019 ACT report indicates that only a minority of companies cover biodiversity and ecosystem conservation in their reports, as further elaborated in paragraph 67.This conclusion on biodiversity and ecosystem conservation, however, is not consistent across all sectors, as companies in certain high-risk sectors such as the Energy & Resource Extraction and Infrastructure, typically do provide such disclosure. Yet, in other high-risk sectors such as Apparel & Textiles, Hospitality & Recreation and Food & Beverages, the percentage of companies disclosing on this topic is strikingly low.Size emerges as a key criterion for environmental disclosures, as the proportion of companies providing relevant disclosures increases for all climate change topics as turnover increases. This is shown in Table 9.Table 9: Number of companies addressing climate change by revenue size",

Although almost all companies disclosed these content categories, significant variation in the extent and quality of disclosures was observed. As \u2018policies\u2019 and \u2018due diligence\u2019 are not defined within the NFRD, there was variation in how companies interpreted these terms.88% of the companies reviewed by CDSB disclosed some environmental and climate-related aspects of their business model, however only one-third did so in a manner that addressed the key aspects outlined in the guidelines to the In the 2020 status report of the TCFD (hereafter \u2018the 2020 TCFD status report\u2019), it was noted that nearly 60% of the world\u2019s 100 largest public companies supported the TCFD, reported in line with the TCFD recommendationsboth. This 2020 TCFD status report noted that disclosure of climate-related financial information, aligned with the TCFD recommendations, had steadily increased since the recommendations were published in 2017. The report also noted a continued need for progress given the urgent demand for consistency and comparability in reporting.More specifically, the 2020 TCFD status report, which provides findings from the review of financial filings, annual reports, integrated reports, and sustainability reports of 1 701 public companies from 69 countries across eight industries, highlights that:a) 42% of companies with a market capitalisation greater than USD 10 billion disclosed at least some information in line with each individual TCFD recommendation in 2019.b) Approximately 60% of the world\u2019s 100 largest public companies support the TCFD, report in line with the TCFD recommendations, or both.c) Energy companies, and Materials and Buildings companies, are leading on disclosure, with an average level of TCFD-aligned disclosures of 40% for Energy companies and 30% for Materials and Buildings companies in fiscal year 2019.d) Expert users of disclosure identified the impact of climate change on a company\u2019s business and strategy as the \u2018most useful\u2019 information for financial decision-making.

However, companies\u2019 disclosure of the potential financial impact of climate change on their businesses, strategies, and financial planning remains low.As shown in Figure 8 below, the greatest increase in the percentage of companies disclosing relevant information from 2017 to 2019 \u2013 11 percentage points \u2013relates to the disclosure of processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks (TCFD recommendation: Risk Management a); whilst the smallest increase relates to the disclosure of companies\u2019 climate-related risks and opportunities (TCFD recommendation: Strategy a), which increased by only one percentage point over the same time period.

However, disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities was nearly as likely to be found in financial filings or annual reports as it was in sustainability reports. In the case of metrics and targets, the review found that 79% of sustainability reports included information aligned with recommended disclosures for metrics and targets, compared to only 15% of annual reports and financial filings containing the equivalent information.One in 15 companies reviewed disclosed information on the resilience of its strategy. The review found that the percentage of companies disclosing the resilience of their strategies, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario, was significantly lower than that of any other recommended disclosure in each year. These results are consistent with feedback which the TCFD has received from companies on the challenges of disclosing such information.Companies\u2019 disclosure of their specific climate-related issues stayed constant, indicating that few companies have revised their perspective on whether climate-related risks and opportunities are appropriate for inclusion in public The percentage of companies disclosing TCFD-aligned information tends to increase with company size. On average, 42% of companies with a market capitalisation of greater than USD 10 billion disclosed information aligned with the TCFD recommendations in 2019, while the average was 15% for companies with a market capitalisation less than USD 2.8 billion.Companies in Europe were found to have the highest percentages of TCFD-aligned disclosures for 10 of the 11 recommended disclosures. This may, in part, be due to the integration of the TCFD recommendations in the non-binding guidelines on climate-related reporting published by the European Commission in June 2019. The Asia Pacific region followed Europe with the second highest percentage of disclosure for 8 of the 11 recommended disclosures. While the North American region had the highest percentage of disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities, the Latin America, Middle East and Africa, and North American regions otherwise had broadly similar percentages of disclosure across the recommended disclosures. The conclusions of the TCFD 2020 status report were supported by research carried out by Moody\u2019s Analytics for a study which reviewed the climate-related disclosures of roughly 12 000 companies. According to the TCFD 2020 status report the Moody\u2019s Analytics study found that about 17% of the companies reviewed reported climate-related information. The TCFD 2020 status report further notes that Vigeo Eiris, an affiliate of Moody\u2019s, also conducted an independent analysis reviewing almost 3 000 companies across regions and sectors, and found that most companies lag in terms of fully aligning with the TCFD recommendations.The TCFD 2020 status report analysed and ranked disclosures by industry (see Figure 9 below). A higher average percentage of disclosure indicates that an industry generally disclosed at a higher rate across the 11 recommended disclosures. Energy companies had the highest average at 40%, with the highest disclosure percentage for 9 of the 11 recommended disclosures, while Materials and Buildings companies had the highest percentage for 2 of the 11 recommendations. Consumer Goods and Technology and Media Companies had the lowest percentage of disclosure in several areas, with overall disclosure averages at 18% and 13%, respectively.Figure 9: Average percentage of disclosure by industrySource: 2020 Status Report: Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, TCFD (2020) \u2013 page 17",

        "text": "Source: An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, The Alliance for Corporate Transparency (2019)According to the 2019 ACT report, corporate disclosure on human rights is often narrative and case specific. Methodologies that allow to report on human rights in quantitative terms are not common, which in broad terms can be explained by the very nature of the matter, namely, that quantifying human rights issues and impacts is challenging.For the purposes of the research leading to the 2019 ACT report, the methodology adopted for the assessment of human rights related disclosures focused on general criteria was derived from the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights Reporting Framework, concerning the identification of the salient human rights issues by companies and their management. It was stated that these criteria naturally fitted the categories of information the NFRD requires companies to report on, namely policies and due diligence procedures, outcomes, principal risks and KPIs. This approach leaves the choice of salient issues at the discretion of companies.According to the research, most companies refer to and disclose policies on human rights, suggesting that many businesses view human rights as material. However relatively few companies disclosed relevant and specific details on policies. An important finding included in the 2019 ACT report, based on the sample of 1 000 companies analysed, concerns disclosure on human rights due diligence. Only 22.2% of companies reported on due diligence processes and only 6.9% referred to their commitment to provide remedy for harmed people.Figure 16: Disclosure on human rights due diligenceSource: An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, The Alliance for Corporate Transparency (2019) \u2013 page 19The high percentage of companies reporting on human rights policies (over 80%) is in contrast with a much lower share describing policy outcomes (less than 40%, and only 6.2% with respect to policy targets). The fact that only 26.4% of companies report data or KPIs is more difficult to evaluate given the lack of methodologies to quantify human rights impacts and their management.Figure 17: Description of policy outcomesSource: An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, The Alliance for Corporate Transparency (2019) \u2013 page 69A minority of companies address impacts on indigenous and/or local community rights across all sectors. However a different outcome is observed when reviewing the disclosures of companies on this topic in the Energy & Resource Extraction sector, where more companies refer to this issue in their reports.The relevance of reporting on high risk areas for civil and political rights depends on a company\u2019s operational context. These risks are most often associated with the Energy & Resource Extraction sector. It is difficult to accurately estimate how many European companies operate in high-risk areas. The results provide a basic perspective on the level of awareness among businesses.Only a small proportion of companies referred to high risk areas for civil and political rights in their reports and to a lesser extend identify high risk areas as a salient human rights issue. While a larger proportion of companies in the Energy & Resource Extraction sector addressed this issue in their reports, results in other sectors are lower still, including potentially high-risk sectors such as Technology & Communications, Apparel & Textiles, and Food & Beverages.Conflict resources include conflict minerals covered by the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation \u2013 tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold \u2013 as well as other resources, such as timber. Technology & Communications and Resource Transformation are considered to be the two sectors most at risk of being linked to conflict minerals. The research behind the 2019 ACT report shows that most of the 1 000 companies reviewed did not cover the issue in their non-financial reporting, although a slightly higher number of companies in the Technology & Communications and Resource Transformation sectors reported on the topic.Anti-corruption & WhistleblowingAccording to the 2019 ACT report, anti-corruption issues are addressed by 96.4% of the sample of 1 000 companies reviewed, with similar results across industries.Issues regarding whistleblowing have lower, but still significant coverage, with almost 77% of the sample of companies reviewed describing policies about this to some extent. Social mattersThe 2019 ACT report notes the difficulty in identifying concrete social issues that would not be classified as either a matter of respecting human rights or as employee-related matters as understood in the previous section.To this end, the issues examined by the 2019 ACT report under the social matters umbrella are employee & workforce matters and taxes.Employee & workforce matters are addressed by 98% of the sample of 1 000 companies analysed, to the degree shown in Figure 18 below.Figure 18: Proportion of companies addressing employee and workforce matters by level of disclosureSource: An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, The Alliance for Corporate Transparency (2019)Further detail, regarding specific topics of particular social relevance, can be seen in Figure 19 below, prepared using information from the 2019 ACT report on the sample of 1 000 companies analysed.Figure 19: Proportion of companies addressing specific topics of employee & workforce matters",

While most companies report on tax policies, only a few companies express specific commitment about paying taxes where profits are generated, and even fewer companies provide information on income taxes paid disaggregated by country.GovernanceThe NFRD does not explicitly require any specific governance-related disclosures even though such disclosures are recommended in a majority of reporting frameworks.The 2019 ACT report notes that only 14% of the sample of 1 000 companies reviewed, report that their Boards discussed specific issues in their non-financial reporting, and only 15% report a link between sustainability objectives and executive remuneration.Based on the sample of 1 000 companies analysed for the purposes of the 2019 ACT report, in terms of reporting in line with the NFRD:a) Between 40 and 50% of companies disclose a declaration of social purpose, the Board\u2019s mandate and supportive procedural governance arrangements;b) Nearly 30% of companies disclose information on Board engagement with workforce representatives; andc) About 14% of companies disclose matters that have more immediate impact on the Board\u2019s accountability for sustainability performance, including compensation, independent assessment, and transparency concerning decisions.Figure 21: Reporting practicesSource: An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, The Alliance for Corporate Transparency (2019) \u2013 page 40UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)The 2019 ACT report concluded that although many companies espouse the Paris Agreement or the SDGs, they still fail to set specific targets in line with them, or measure their progress accordingly. Of those who set climate targets, only 14% align to Paris Agreement goals, for example. Most of all, given the high level of business debate around the SDGs, the 2019 ACT report notes that with the exception of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain and Sweden, only a minority of companies in other EU countries make any reference to the SDGs in their reports across the rest of the European Union. The Carrots & Sticks 2020 report, which performed an analysis and high-level connections between reporting provisions and the SDGs, notes that the SDGs most implied by reporting provisions, directly or indirectly, are the ones more directly associated with business operations, e.g. SDG 12 on responsible production and consumption, SDG 16 on inclusive societies and accountable institutions, as well as SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth.

This becomes very transparent through the findings of the 2019 ACT report, which presents an analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the NFRD.A study carried out by PwC in 2019, also across a sample of 1 000 company reports, found that nearly three quarters of the companies (72%) considered in their study publicly mentioned the SDGs in their reporting publications. Of the companies that mentioned the SDGs, 59% referenced them as part of their sustainability report while just over half (51%) mentioned them in their annual report. However, just 34% of those that mentioned the SDGs (25% of all companies analysed), did so in sections of their reporting that discussed business strategy. PwC found that out of the companies analysed, 65% mentioned specific SDGs with Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8) being the most popular goal identified by business (a common observation in both years when the study was carried out).The PwC study looked at how companies were focusing on the 169 targets that underpin the 17 SDGs as an indication of whether the goals were being integrated into business strategy. The findings indicated that only 14% (157 companies) mentioned specific SDG targets. Of those, 39% set qualitative ambitions and 20% set quantitative ambitions. Only 8% reported quantitative measures to show progress towards targets representing only 1% of all the companies analysed.WBCSD\u2019s report \u2018Reporting Matters 2019\u2019, noted that the vast majority (93%) of the companies in their review referenced specific SDGs in their report. Nearly half (43%) prioritised five to eight SDGs, with a relatively small number (16%) referencing 12 or more SDGs. For the fourth straight year, the most referenced SDGs were: (i) SDG 13: Climate action (88%), (ii) SDG 12: Sustainable cities and communities (79%), and (iii) SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth (73%). Those SDGs least likely to be prioritised were SDG 1: No poverty (24%), SDG 14: Life under water (24%) and SDG 6: Peace and justice \u2013 strong institutions (29%).",

About one fifth explicitly discuss ties between the materiality assessment process and the SDGs (24%). c) An increasing number of reports align KPIs (20% vs 6% in 2019) and targets (28% vs 15% in 2019) to the SDGs. d) About a third (32%) tie SDGs to case studies or detailed evidence of sustainability programs and initiatives undertaken during the reporting period (19% in 2019). As was the case in 2019, very few (1\u20133%) refer to enterprise risk management and human rights in relation to the SDGs.Figure 23: Frequency of reference to specific SDGsSource: Reporting Matters 2019, WBCSD (2020) \u2013 page 20Sector specific disclosuresCommon topics for the extractive industries are those related to transparency of payments to foreign governments, human rights and conflict minerals. An example is the Act on Transparency Measures in the Mining, Oil, and Gas Industries (2016) by the Government of Quebec in Canada.

This analysis showed that 60% of those companies integrated key non-financial information in their annual report.For the CDSB 2020 report \u2018Falling short? Why environmental and climate-related disclosures under the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive must improve\u2019, the CDSB reviewed the 2019 environmental and climate-related disclosures of Europe\u2019s 50 largest listed companies, with a combined market capitalisation of USD 4.3 trillion. In this report the CDSB notes that 84% of companies used their mainstream report as the primary location of their non-financial statement. Approximately 10% used a separate sustainability report, with 4% preparing a standalone non-financial information statement in addition to their mainstream and sustainability reports. Of those that provided disclosure within the mainstream report, 55% integrated the content within relevant report sections (such as strategy, risk and corporate governance), whereas 45% included a stand-alone statement with the content presented in its own section. Those choosing to integrate the information adopted a \u2018hybrid\u2019 approach, where business model, due diligence and principal risk disclosures were integrated, but policies, outcomes and KPIs were published in a dedicated environmental or climate-related section of the report.Figure 24: Primary location of non-financial statement required by the NFRDSource: Falling short? Why environmental and climate-related disclosures under the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive must improve, CDSB (2020) \u2013 page 24Regarding connectivity, the CDSB noted that many companies chose to include cross-reference tables within their mainstream report, sign-posting readers to the location of the specific content on \u2018environmental matters\u2019 within the mainstream report, and to separate disclosures where appropriate. Similarly, many disclosures included page references and links within and between report sections, for example linking risks to outcome disclosures, which are meant to support the reader in gaining an understanding of the company\u2019s overall position, performance and approach.According to WBCSD\u2019s report \u2018Reporting Matters 2020\u2019 benchmarking its member companies worldwide, the relative percentage of stand-alone sustainability reports has dropped from 65% in 2017 to 59% in 2020, due to the increase in self-declared integrated/combined reports and annual reports that combine sustainability and financial information. WBCSD notes that its European headquartered member companies are more likely than its Asian and North American headquartered member companies to combine sustainability and financial information into a single report (55% compared with 32% and 11%, respectively).",

According to this study, only the UK and France have required the non-financial information statement to be included in the annual management report rather than providing the option allowed by the NFRD to publish as a separate report. The Frank Bold paper posited that this requirement gives gravity and prominence to the non-financial reporting statement, which is circulated to shareholders on a yearly basis ahead of the general meeting. It went further to say that this approach also improves the integration of financial and non-financial reporting. Conversely, in Germany, if the non-financial information statement is not included in the annual management report, it can be published on the company\u2019s website up to four months afterwards, provided that the annual management report refers to this publication and the website. The paper posited that this time lag means that shareholders whose attention is captured for the purposes of reviewing the annual management report and preparing for the annual meeting, may be lost, and non-financial information may therefore not be given the same level of attention. The Frank Bold paper noted that BASF (a German chemical company), Deutsche Bank and Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG have all said that providing information in a separate report would be a step backwards.The Carrots & Sticks 2020 report noted that large companies are currently disclosing non-financial information in their annual reports, periodic reports, investor briefs, newsletters, press releases as well as web announcements and engagement events. The report found 165 cases explicitly referring to annual reports (or components thereof such as management discussion & analysis, directors\u2019 report or governance report) and 80 cases that mention sustainability or non-financial reports, whilst the data collected included 175 cases where nothing was specified and 42 cases where specific reference is made to other data disclosures and statements.

The only electronic format that has been promoted by non-financial reporting initiatives is XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language). Each of the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), the European Central Bank (ECB) and ESMA, have endorsed the European Single Electronic format (ESEF). ESMA\u2019s endorsement relates to issuers on EU regulated markets preparing their annual reports. and AECA support electronic formats not only to promote better data quality and analysis of the non-financial information, but also to overcome the misalignment between the reporting of material non-financial information and financial reporting, in effect amplifying the concept of double materiality.In the financial reporting landscape, XBRL is already used by more than 10 million companies across 60 countries and implemented by 179 regulators covering the majority of public companies globally. Figure 28 reflects the adoption and implementation of XBRL by capital markets for financial reporting, observing 53 instances on a global basis as of 2020.

        "text": "Which type of technology framework/platform was used to provide non-financial information?The Association of Accountants and Financial Professionals in Business (IMA) published a report in 2020 entitled \u2018A digital transformation brief: Business reporting in the fourth industrial revolution\u2019, presenting research relevant to digital transformation. From the preparers\u2019 perspective, many entities covered by the NFRD rely on manual processes, large teams, third-party consultants, and a variety of proprietary point solutions, such as business productivity software, email, and general-purpose collaboration software, to provide the requested data and disclosure. Exacerbating these reporting challenges is the continued growth in size and complexity of many organisations with employees and data located all around the world. One of the issues identified is that traditional information management solutions may not provide the agility, scalability and scope to economically permit a more comprehensive NFRD information management process. Physically connecting disparate information from internal and external data systems creates a costly information processing environment that is not adequate or agile enough to support both internal and external supply chain non-financial information sources. Traditional information management solutions may not provide the agility, scalability and scope to economically permit this more comprehensive NFRD information management process.According to a recent report by the Transparency Market Research Group (a global market intelligence company), preparers are starting to implement cloud-based disclosure management solutions in order to publish statutory disclosures. The report states that disclosure management solutions are one of the steps expected to gain significant traction in the near future due to the rising need for managing disclosure information within organisations. Many software vendors are venturing into the disclosure management software market. Key players operating in the market include SAP, Oracle, Certent, IRIS Business Services, Workiva, CoreFiling, DataTracks, LucaNet, OCR Services, Tagetik Software, Synthesis Technology, Anaqua, Trintech, and Lecorpio. Accelerating digitisation has become more urgent as the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the inadequacies of systems that rely on outdated, insecure technology and that operate with vast voids of fragmented disclosure information.The abovementioned IMA study showed that physically connecting disparate information systems from internal and external data systems creates a costly information processing environment that may not be adequate or agile enough to support both internal and external supply chain information sources for non-financial information.A challenge for non-financial information data management control systems and sustainability control systems is to support the implementation of an integrated sustainability strategy. The configuration of an organisation\u2019s control system and reporting system may vary across sustainability dimensions and type of company due to its size and activity. For example, it is plausible that an organisation\u2019s environmental and financial control systems might be tightly coupled in cases where there is a clear association between environmental performance (e.g. energy efficiency and waste reduction) and cost reduction. On the other hand, it may be difficult to determine such an association with respect to social activities (e.g. engagement in community activities) and financial performance. Thus, there is a need for empirical evidence that examines these differences so reporting alone may not be enough. NFRD reporting entities are seeking management systems that can meet many versions of non-financial information reporting. Assessing relevant information from across these comprehensive strategic areas is one of the most difficult tasks for NFRD reporting teams. It requires establishing common definitions for critical information and potentially rethinking the association between strategy drivers and the underlying processes and related performance metrics. This often requires a better, more holistic approach to company KPIs \u2013 those that are integrated into the company\u2019s long-term strategy for value creation across all stakeholders.Building on these requirements, there is a need for well trained professional resources within companies that are responsible for sourcing, aggregating and consolidating this information, with well-designed controls, processes and procedures that ensure that the data is reliable, timely, comparable and accurate (Figure 30).",

Hence, any investor who wants to compare companies across different member states must access a different OAM for each company. Furthermore, member states have different national mechanisms for storing information about companies, which all work in slightly different ways, and the information they provide varies in terms of scope and quality. Figure 31: The Transparency Directive reporting flowSource: IMP\u2019s Non-Financial Digitisation Working Group and IMAAll companies, regardless of size, file reports to a national business registry in EU Member States. Different business registers operate within different legal frameworks, and companies need to comply with the laws of each jurisdiction. The national business registers validate the completeness of the filed reports and calculations and those reports are offered to the general public as a public database normally subject to a specific cost. It is important to note that there were estimated to be approximately 25.1 million SMEs in the European Union in 2018, with the vast majority being micro-sized enterprises which employed fewer than nine people. Only 1.47 million of those enterprises had between 10 and 49 employees and approximately 236 thousand had 50 to 249 employers.Figure 32: Company annual reports and Business Registers disclosure processSource: Graph Source: IMP\u2019s Non-Financial Digitisation Working Group",

Applying to approximately 6 000 large companies in the EU (listed companies, banks, insurance companies, other companies designated by national authorities as PIEs), the law requires these corporations to \u2018include in the management report a non-financial statement containing information to the extent necessary for an understanding of the undertaking\u2019s development, performance, position and impact of its activity, relating to, as a minimum, environmental, social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and bribery matters\u2019The NFRD gives companies significant flexibility to disclose relevant information in the way they consider most useful. Companies may use international, European or national guidelines to produce their non-financial statements. In June 2017, the European Commission published guidelines on non-financial information reporting, to help companies disclose environmental and social information. These guidelines are not mandatory, and companies may decide to use international, European or national guidelines according to their own characteristics or business environment.Considering the loose definition of which information to disclose in detail, and in which format, there is a high degree of inconsistency in non-financial information disclosures, in respect of content and structure This creates complexity on the side of preparers and ambiguity for users of the disclosed information. The field of technology for disclosing non-financial information is not yet well developed, which makes the processing and use of non-financial information difficult.The following subsections describe the key issues related to content, structure and technology in more detail, with reference to respective evidence from the research reports reviewed for the purposes of the assessment of Stream A6.Content",

Yet the scope of the directive as it stands today falls short on both principles.The 2019 ACT report observes that about half of the 1 000 companies analysed do not generally disclose information useful for decision making. Approximately a third of the companies report well-developed sustainability policies, but these fail to provide evidence around impacts. Only 20% of the companies provide information that allows such understanding. This research concludes that the quality and comparability of companies\u2019 sustainability reporting across the NFRD\u2019s five topics is not sufficient for understanding their impacts, risks or plans.In October 2019, the UK\u2019s Financial Reporting Council (FRC) issued an online consultation seeking stakeholder views and expectations for the future of corporate reporting. According to the published survey conclusions, 51% of respondents said that they are always interested in information about how a company\u2019s activities affect the environment, communities, customers and suppliers.

A lack of comparability and a lack of trust are among the reasons cited qualitatively by users for not engaging with sustainability reports more thoroughly.In summary, the evidence collected through the literature review carried out by Stream A6, regarding existing perceptions and issues noted by various stakeholder groups on what is reported in terms of content, highlights the following issues:a) Lack of conciseness in reporting;b) Matters affecting comparability, include: Lack of common frameworks and freedom to select and combine different frameworks;Differences and lack of clarity in regulatory terminology, leaving key matters such as materiality open to interpretation;Lack of common and standardised metrics;(iv) Inconsistent national implementation of the NFRD in law;Different levels of maturity on the topic of sustainability across the EU;(vi) Proliferation of sector specific requirements; and(vii) Differing levels of maturity across reporting organisations of the reporting process including responsibilities, systems and processes;c) Lack of consistency;d) Lack of clarity on the definition of materiality;e) Inconsistent interpretation and implementation of reporting boundaries, particularly regarding supply chain aspects;f) Unclear definition of component parts of the business and the value creation model;g) Lack of explicit requirements and methodologies for the disclosure of goals and targets as well as data to track progress on risks and KPIs;h) Lack of connectivity of non-financial information disclosed at various points in time and across different channels, as well as lack of connectivity with financial information;i) Difficulties in measuring and disclosing impacts and a focus on inputs and outputs which are not helpful in assessing performance;j) Reluctance to provide meaningful forward-looking information on value creation;k) Less forthcoming reporting of potential opportunities; andl) Heterogeneous coverage of reporting topics across companies.ConcisenessA report published in 2019 by BEIS on stakeholder perceptions of non-financial reporting (hereafter \u2018the BEIS research report\u2019) concludes that corporate reporting has come under criticism in recent years for being lengthy and lacking focus.

In its publication \u2018Reporting Matters , the WBCSD noted that, across its 159 member companies worldwide, the average length of corporate reports that combine sustainability and financial information was 246 pages \u2013 the shortest report reviewed being 7 pages while the longest was 620 pages. The WBCSD pointed out that the length of corporate reports varied widely and was influenced by ownership type (private vs listed) and geography given the differing regulatory obligations across jurisdictions.CDSB\u2019s 2020 report \u2018Falling short? Why environmental and climate-related disclosures under the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive must improve\u2019, analysed the 2019 environmental and climate-related disclosures of Europe\u2019s 50 largest listed companies with a combined market capitalisation of USD 4.3 trillion. As part of their review, CDSB looked at the conciseness of the disclosures and noted that on average, companies included 14 pages of environmental and climate-related content in their mainstream report, with a range of 1-70 pages and an average of 5% of the mainstream report dedicated to the topic. The longest environmental and climate related disclosure which did not include all the requirements of the NFRD was 14 pages; the shortest disclosure which included all the relevant content categories was just 2 pages. CDSB observed that the strongest disclosures, which balanced comprehensive disclosure of relevant environmental and climate-related information with concise reporting, were no longer than 5-10 pages. It concluded that whilst some organisations are choosing to produce significant disclosures under the NFRD, this demonstrates that less might at times indeed be more.As the ACCA 2019 report critique for the IIRC points out, conciseness focuses the reader\u2019s attention on the most important aspects of the business by applying the materiality principle and not obscuring the significant information in a mass of less relevant information. Most readers want to have a succinct overall picture of the entity, at least as a starting point. Information on particular aspects and in greater detail could be referenced as linked reports \u2013 for example, the full financial statements and further non-financial information. Clearly there is a balance between keeping the report concise and ensuring the completeness of the information and its comparability over time or with that of other organisations.The BEIS research report notes that, investor frustrations with the reports and the value they can derive from them, tend to centre on their length as well as the sometimes vague and wordy nature of the information contained within them. Some annual reports exceed 300 pages, making them inaccessible to investors, who find it difficult to quickly identify information which is relevant, interesting and/or material to their decision-making. The BEIS research report also notes that another criticism often heard is that non-financial reporting still tends to include a lot of \u2018generic marketing and public relations\u2019 type content that lacks substance, whilst failing to address key strategic risks. The length of reports could be driven, in some instances, by a desire to appease topical single-issue lobby groups.The BEIS research report further notes there is resulting confusion around the purpose of non-financial reporting, which leads companies to follow a tick box approach to compliance rather than focusing on producing meaningful information on their value creation and performance. A lot of non-financial reports are rather limited to sustainability related information and mainly environmental information within that.The clearer and more focused the objectives and more specific the key stakeholders of non-financial reporting are, the more concise and effective the reporting will be. In practice companies are providing non-financial information through separate channels in an attempt to keep their annual reports streamlined whilst meeting the specific needs of a wider group of stakeholders.",

        "text": "ComparabilityA major area of criticism of non-financial reporting by companies across Europe is the lack of comparability. Non-financial reporting is criticised for being inconsistent, incomplete and difficult to compare, which impedes a robust analysis and decision making based on the information provided in corporate reports.This lack of comparability of reporting across the EU is mainly triggered by:a) a lack of a common framework and freedom of reporting entities to select and combine different frameworks to produce non-financial information;b) differences and lack of clarity in terminology used in relevant national laws and regulations, leaving things open for interpretation;c) lack of common and standardised metrics; d) inconsistent transposition and implementation of the NFRD by Member States;e) a proliferation of sector specific requirements; and f) differing levels of maturity across reporting organisations of the reporting process including responsibilities, systems and processes.Lack of common framework and freedom to select and combine different frameworksSection 1 of this document makes reference to a vast number of different frameworks, standards and guidance initiatives currently in place. As pointed out in a discussion paper published by the FRC in October 2020 on the future of corporate , there is some regulation relating to non-financial reporting but there is also a multitude of voluntary frameworks which creates a confusing landscape for companies and results in a lack of relevant, reliable, comparable and balanced information for users.Although the NFRD does not prescribe a reporting framework, it encourages companies to disclose information in accordance with widely accepted reporting standards and frameworks, requiring companies to state which ones they have relied on. The European Commission non-binding guidelines on non-financial reporting mention frameworks such as the TCFD, GRI, CDP, CDSB, SASB, IIRC and the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). In transposing the NFRD into national law, Member States have also included other national standards and frameworks, adding to the confusion and variety of reporting across Europe. Furthermore, the available standards and frameworks are not mutually exclusive, and compliance with more than one of them is possible and increasingly common (see Section 1 of this document).Differences and lack of clarity in terminology used in regulation leaving things open for interpretationThe Frank Bold paper comparing the implementation of the NFRD in the UK, Germany, France and Italy, points out that there are areas where the NFRD is not clear about its intention, particularly in relation to the meaning of materiality and the way the business model should be reported on. Frank Bold observes that the surveyed jurisdictions have replicated the wording of the NFRD, failing to provide any further clarity.The same Frank Bold paper notes the NFRD\u2019s failure to specify the scope of reporting between companies and jurisdictions, as well as how the non-financial information statement should reference aspects of financial reporting, with the surveyed jurisdictions failing to provide clarity on these points as well.",

        "text": "For the UK, the BEIS research report on stakeholder perceptions of non-financial reporting, points out that over half of the respondents that participated in the research mentioned the variations in reporting between companies and the consequent difficulties in comparing reports. The need for clarity or greater guidance around some of the terminology was also suggested by the respondents.Lack of common and standardised metricsThe Frank Bold paper comparing the implementation of the NFRD in the UK, Germany, France and Italy, notes that the NFRD fails to provide any specific KPIs that should be applied by companies, or any guidance as to what they should be trying to illustrate. From the countries surveyed for the Frank Bold paper only France sets out KPIs in the implementing legislation (such as frequency and severity of workplace accidents), while the other countries do not set out specific KPIs or how they should be measured. According to the BEIS research report the multitude of KPIs used across companies makes comparative analysis very difficult.Inconsistent implementation of the NFRD in different member statesMember States have implemented the NFRD in varying ways, with different approaches on key issues, such as the definition of PIEs or the level of assurance required (see Section 1 for more details).Differing levels of maturity across reporting organisations of the reporting process including responsibilities, systems and processes According to a report by ECIIA \u2018Non-Financial Reporting: Building trust with internal audit\u2019, the implementation of the NFRD has impacted organisations in differing ways. Some have already established reporting on non-financial information whereas others have not. Indeed, some may have decided not to implement the new reporting requirements and prefer to explain their reasons for not complying. The ECIIA report notes that in order to fulfil their corporate social responsibility, companies should have in place a process to integrate social, environmental, ethical, human rights and consumer concerns into their business operations and core strategy, in close collaboration with their stakeholders, with the aim of: (a) maximising the creation of shared value for owners/shareholders, other stakeholders and society at large, and (b) identifying, preventing and mitigating possible adverse impact from operations.A recent series of roundtables jointly conducted by ecoDa and Mazars during 2019 and 2020, highlighted that one of the key challenges for a wholehearted commitment to sustainability across the business community in Europe, was that the focus on sustainability is often seen by many businesses as primarily a box-ticking compliance exercise, rather than a process for deeply embedding considerations of sustainability across all aspects of the business. It was further noted that the emphasis of company boards tends to be on short-term financial performance, without much attention on sustainability considerations at board level.According to the European Commission Summary Report of the Public Consultation on the Review of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, there is strong support for assurance for non-financial information, with 67% of respondents believing that the EU should impose stronger audit requirements for non-financial information. The summary goes on to say that some respondents stated that auditors are best placed to provide assurance on non-financial information, while a smaller number mentioned that this should not necessarily be the case.",

        "text": "Consistency For the purposes of the Stream A6 assessment, consistency of non-financial information is considered in the context of applying the same frameworks and standards, and using the same approach for the same items. This should be the case from one reporting period to the next for a reporting entity, or in a single reporting period across different entities. The lack of consistency of non-financial information is currently a major issue which stems from different factors, including: the lack of explicit requirements for explanation of variances in the data e.g. frequent changes in the basis of measurement; the lack of requirements for systems, processes and controls around the collection and management of non-financial information; and the data still not being fully embedded in the business model. Until these issues are overcome, it will be difficult for management, auditors and other stakeholders to exercise a level of scrutiny over non-financial information similar to that in place for financial information.This is further accentuated by the lack of mandatory requirements for independent assurance by regulated assurance providers and the ever-increasing number of reporting frameworks which mean that non-financial information disclosures may be subject to change from one year to the next, as a result of applying a different approach for measuring and disclosing data. Such changes are not in all cases fully explained in the notes, rendering the use and interpretation of the data rather difficultIn the ACCA 2019 report critique for the IIRC, that provides a picture of the trends and developments over a four year period, the authors note that consistency of the reporting over time is one area where improvement was observed in the reports reviewed by ACCA. Reviewers looked for performance with comparative figures and a continuity in the reporting of KPIs from one year to the next. ACCA highlights that this is essential for users in identifying trends in performance. In addition, retaining the same performance measures from one year to another helps to give readers a sense that the report has a balance between the reporting of good and bad news and that KPIs that have turned negative have not then been dropped out. ACCA concludes that consistency and comparability are both aspects that have shown an improving trend over the four year period of their reviews.On the other hand, a Mazars UK study of FTSE 350 disclosures of GHG emissions, published in February 2020, uncovered big spikes in reported emissions, suggesting unexplained volatility. Where explanations were provided, they were \u2018not as elaborate or developed as would be expected for similar changes in profit or revenue\u2019. The research shows that current disclosure of GHG emissions by listed companies is not fit-for-purpose and is in many cases a box-ticking exercise that does not appear to be integral to the way management runs the business.MaterialityAccording to the Frank Bold paper comparing the implementation of the NFRD in the UK, Germany, France and Italy, the materiality test (i.e. the test for what extent of information on each of the ESG factors needs to be provided) remains unclear across the surveyed jurisdictions.The Frank Bold paper notes that although the NFRD prescribes that information must be provided to the \u2018extent necessary for an understanding of the company\u2019s development, performance and position and the impact of its activity\u2019, there has been very little information provided (in the UK, Germany, Italy and France) as to how to determine the \u2018extent necessary\u2019.Directive 2013/34/EU (the \u2018Accounting Directive\u2019), which the NFRD amends to include the provisions relating to the non-financial information statement, provides that the \u2018extent necessary\u2019 requires information to be provided \u2018where its omission or misstatement could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that users make on the basis of the financial statements of the undertaking\u2019. The Frank Bold paper notes that it is unclear who these \u2018users\u2019 or \u2018readers\u2019 might be. This led some of the countries in the sample addressed by the Frank Bold paper, specifically the UK and Italy, to taking the approach of \u2018investor materiality\u2019 rather than a wider range of stakeholders.",

        "text": "In the case of principal risks, the NFRD states that companies \u2018should provide adequate information in relation to matters that stand out as being most likely to bring about the materialisation of principal risks of severe impacts\u2019, and for these purposes the severity of impacts should be judged by their \u2018scale and gravity\u2019.The Frank Bold paper notes that this suggests that as regards the impact of principal risks, the materiality test should be based on the scale and gravity of the materialisation of the risk, rather than whether knowledge of a principal risk would influence readers\u2019 economic decisions (which appears to be the applicable test for materiality elsewhere in the NFRD). This distinction in the materiality test for \u2018impact\u2019 as opposed to other aspects of the report does not appear to be clearly made in the transposition of the NFRD to national law in the four jurisdictions considered for the Frank Bold paper.The Frank Bold paper further notes that the NFRD requires reporting on principal risks related to business relationships to be provided \u2018where it is relevant and proportionate\u2019. With the exception of Italy, this condition is included in the national transpositions in the jurisdictions considered for the Frank Bold paper, but no guidance is provided for its interpretation. According to the Frank Bold paper there is also substantial uncertainty over what \u2018impact\u2019 might mean. This is particularly unfortunate given that the countries surveyed (UK, France, Germany and Italy) previously required companies to report on their development, performance and position in the context of ESG factors, but none of them required impact reporting. European Commission guidance says this should cover \u2018positive or adverse\u2019 impacts and that a company should disclose material information on principal risks \u2018regardless of whether they stem from its own decisions or actions of from external factors\u2019. On this basis, it can be assumed that both positive and negative impacts should be reported on.The Frank Bold paper concludes that the lack of clarity from the NFRD on materiality leads to problems, as materiality is one of the most fundamental aspects of reporting. Without a clear definition, companies may take significantly diverging approaches in relation to the extent of information that they provide, whilst complying with the broader requirements for reporting in general. The risk is that even if the procedural aspect of preparing a report is complied with, the more substantive aspect of providing useful information on ESG factors is still not guaranteed.The BEIS research report on stakeholder perceptions of non-financial reporting noted that materiality was a key concern for respondents, particularly in terms of how significant and specific the risks identified are, and in relation to their potential impact. Several respondents highlighted the different ways in which companies determine what is material and what is not, which in turn leads to a lack of comparability between company reports.Organisational reporting boundariesOrganisational boundary setting affects reporting of general sustainability and other non-financial information.A paper issued by the CDSB \u2018Proposals for boundary setting in mainstream reports \u2013 Discussion paper on organizational boundary setting by groups of companies for non-financial reporting purposes\u2019 discusses the way in which a group of companies determines its boundaries for non-financial reporting purposes, highlighting that it is important for numerous reasons, including transparency, comparability and benchmarking. However, different requirements and interpretations exist on whether and to what extent non-financial reporting should include information about the activities of a parent company, its subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, investees, suppliers, upstream and downstream activities and the impacts of the group\u2019s activities.The CDSB paper points out that the structure of corporate groups can change regularly, expanding and contracting with different priorities, opportunities and economic cycles worldwide. This affects the way in which management defines the boundaries of groups of companies for reporting purposes, as do other factors including legislation, voluntary protocols, the objectives of reporting, the placement of information, financial reporting rules, the structure of the corporate group and the availability of data.",

        "text": "For financial reporting purposes, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) prescribe the way in which assets, liabilities and transactions are accounted for in relation to subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and investments as well as what disclosures should be made about respective interests. The CDSB paper notes that in the absence of an equivalent standardised approach to organisational boundary setting for non-financial corporate reporting purposes, it is not always clear how information prepared to comply with national legislation or under voluntary schemes, is \u2018consolidated\u2019 into a mainstream corporate report taking into consideration all entities included in a corporate group. As the CDSB paper explains, this reduces the transparency, reliability and comparability of information. For example, performance indicators and intensity metrics become difficult to create, compare and understand where the boundary selected for non-financial reporting does not align with the basis on which financial or production-related information has been prepared. Performance results and inventory figures may also be distorted. Furthermore, lack of clarity may lead to double counting of information or indeed double non-accounting.The CDSB paper discusses how the concept of consolidation is firmly established in mainstream reporting practice in so far as the preparation of financial statements is concerned. However, the extent and how \u2018consolidation\u2019 is applied to non-financial reporting is less clear. The NFRD indicates that consolidation is required for non-financial reporting, and the content and scope of non-financial reporting seems to automatically extend the boundary of the organisation beyond those matters over which it has direct control and significant influence. This results from the fact that some of the most significant environmental and social risks and opportunities may be found outside a company\u2019s organisational boundaries, in the supply chain and the environment.There is a need to reconcile non-financial reporting requirements that, by definition, extend beyond the established boundaries as organisations have taken different approaches to resolving this dilemma. The CDSB paper discussion summarises that although existing practice is varied, there is evidence of some coalescence (at least by CDSB, IIRC and SASB) around the view that non-financial results should be prepared according to or should be capable of reconciling with financial information prepared according to financial consolidation rules. This does not preclude other information being provided separately if it exposes the reporting organisation to risk.In the CDSB paper, it is noted that organisational boundary approaches selected by 402 of the Global 500 companies that responded to CDP in 2011, show that operational control is the most selected approach. Although there is no obvious statistical evidence of trends within sectors, 20 of the 402 companies that make up the population in the first table of Figure 33 are categorised as being in the utilities sector. Of those companies, six used the equity share approach, six financial control and six used the operational control approach, with two companies indicating that they used \u2018other\u2019 approaches. This would suggest an even spread of approaches amongst Global 500 utilities companies. The second table of Figure 33 below shows the same information from CDP disclosures for 2012. Again, operational control is the most used approach.Figure 33Source: Proposals for boundary setting in mainstream reports \u2013 Discussion paper on organizational boundary setting by groups of companies for non-financial reporting purposes, CDSB (2014) \u2013 page 10The research for the 2019 ACT report across 1 000 companies who were subject to the NFRD requirements, identified that, whilst the NFRD asks companies to focus not only on their direct operations, but also on their supply and subcontracting chains \u2026a) \u2026 over three-in-four of the companies assessed do not provide information about supply chain transparency in their reports; b) \u2026 less than 1% of the companies assessed publicly list their suppliers, even in high-risk sectors;c) The notable exception is the Apparel sector in which 36% of assessed companies provide at least a general description of the location of their supply chains, and an additional almost 14% disclose the list of the actual suppliers;d) In the case of GHG emissions, more than two-thirds of the companies assessed provide specific KPIs for direct emissions (scope 1). However, this drops to little more than half when emissions from energy use are considered (scope 2), and just over one-third when applied to the company\u2019s value chain (scope 3).A scholarly article published in 2013 by A Smith \u2018An Analysis of GHG Reporting Practices and their Implications for the Design of Reporting Programmes\u2019, mentions unpublished research which indicated that the choice of boundary can change GHG emissions results by as much as 73% in one case.A study carried out by Oxford Brookes found that 72% of FTSE 100 sustainability reports adopted very narrow reporting boundaries, restricting the scope of responsibility or using illustrative examples to suggest wider compliance, while in reality providing information that could be described as \u2018greenwashing\u2019. According to the same study, other companies \u2013 26% of the FTSE 100 \u2013 widened the boundary of their sustainability reporting to include impacts derived from operations they owned, controlled or significantly influenced.Supply chainThe scope of data goes beyond the legal boundaries of a reporting entity. The purchase of goods and services can affect the impact an organisation has on society and increase its exposure to risk.The NFRD requires companies to focus not only on their direct operations, but also on their supply and subcontracting chains. Yet according to the research carried out for the 2019 ACT report, over three in four of the sample of 1 000 companies analysed, do not provide information about supply chain transparency in their reports, with less than 1% publicly listing their suppliers, even in high-risk sectors.Obtaining accurate and reliable information from an organisation\u2019s supply chain poses challenges around availability, quality and reliability. Such information from the supply chain might not always be available to a company, or not at the same standard as its own non-financial information.As a result, the process for producing this type of information relies on estimates and judgements. There are different approaches for the estimation of information not readily available from the supply chain. Each company is free to choose the one that works for them, something that impacts comparability. Similarly, there are no requirements for disclosure of the methodology used, rendering it even more difficult for users of the information to consider it in their decision-making process.For example, reported Scope 3 data may not always be complete and the way it is collected/arrived at can be highly subjective. The GHG Protocol Scope 3 Standard is the only internationally accepted method for companies to account for these types of value chain emissions. In a 2016 article \u2018The Scope 3 Emissions Challenge\u2019 the author notes that according to some estimates, more than 80% of the GHG impacts for most companies occur outside of their own operations. The article author concludes that from an environmental and business perspective, managing Scope 3 emissions becomes crucial, and if it can be found meaningful and measurable reduction targets, then this could represent not only the biggest opportunity in terms of potential emission reductions, but also potential financial savings.An article published by ecoact in 2016 notes that measuring emissions in the value chain helps to identify key focus areas and where action needs to be taken. It also contributes to a range of business needs as well as addressing stakeholder demands. Measuring Scope 1 and 2 emissions is standard practice for many large and listed companies. Research into the sustainability reporting performance of the FTSE 100 by ecoact found only one company not providing this information publicly. According to another factsheet by ecoact \u2018Climate and the value chain: A roadmap for Scope 3 emissions reductions\u2019, in the context of stakeholder demand and the need to manage business risk, companies are increasingly looking to understand emissions in their value chain (Scope 3 emissions). FTSE 100 companies are already reporting some Scope 3 data. In many cases, these companies are reporting emissions that are easy to calculate, for example business travel. But these emissions may not be the most important to the business. In fact, the ecoact research showed that only a quarter of the FTSE 100 companies are performing materiality assessments of their Scope 3 emissions, suggesting that in many cases the reported Scope 3 categories may be the ones that are the most readily available, rather than those which are most significant within the business.",

        "text": "Business model / value creation modelThe Frank Bold paper comparing the implementation of the NFRD in the UK, Germany, Italy and France, points out that the NFRD requires a brief description of a company\u2019s business model to be included in its non-financial statement. However, it does not clarify how the description of the business model should refer to the ESG factors that the non-financial information statement considers. There is therefore a risk that companies provide a description of their business model that is disconnected from the ESG matters at hand (for example the impacts of carbon risk in the forecasting of an energy company), thus undermining the usefulness of such reporting.The Frank Bold paper notes that, from the jurisdictions surveyed, only Italy has clarified the intention of the NFRD by including in its implementing legislation the requirement for a company\u2019s description of its business model to expressly refer to the ESG factors that are being reported on.There is similar lack of clarity in the NFRD over the extent to which the non-financial information statement should make specific reference to a company\u2019s financial information. The abovementioned Frank Bold paper notes that each of the countries surveyed makes reference to the fact that the non-financial information statement should refer to, and include additional explanation of, amounts included in the company\u2019s financial statements, although Germany and France qualify the need for such references on a \u2018required\u2019 basis. The Frank Bold paper concludes that further guidance is needed on how such references might be made, the level of detail they might go into, and how companies should integrate non-financial information into their forecasting, in order to strengthen this aspect of corporate reporting.ESMA has provided guidance on how to deal with this aspect of reporting in its Public Statement \u2018European common enforcement priorities for 2020 annual financial reports\u2019. ESMA emphasises that in order to enable users of non-financial statements to get an understanding of the business model and its relationship with and implications for the non-financial matters, issuers are expected to provide information about their strategy together with its implementation, and explain how the business model impacts on, and is being impacted by, the non-financial matters, taking into account their short-, medium- and long-term goals/objectives. ESMA further considers that it would be helpful if issuers were to disclose their definition of value creation and to explicitly mention, if relevant, the disclosure framework which provided this definition, and also to describe how an entity generates and preserves value through its products or services and provides an overview of how a company operates and the rationale of its structure by describing how it transforms inputs into outputs through its business activities. It also stresses that issuers are expected to highlight and explain when material changes to their business model and their value creation ability have taken place in the reporting year.In the 2019 report critique for the IIRC by ACCA, that provides a picture of integrated reporting trends and developments over a four year period, the authors note that quality ratings for the description of the business model have been declining, and this is an area that the IIRC was contemplating to address in any revision of the <IR> Framework in 2020. They go on to note that this may be a result of the predominance of financial organisations in the sample reviewed which might find explaining their business model more difficult than other companies.The ACCA report above also notes that information about strategy and resource allocation is not always linked to the value-creation process over the shorter and longer time frames. It further mentions that ACCA carried out reporting reviews for their corresponding 2017 research that investigated the links of strategy and value creation over the short, medium and longer term and the challenges for those preparing the corporate reports. Among the issues noted were a focus from management on the short-term, even where a business might be investing in long-term projects. Also, strategy and reporting may be handled by different teams in the organisation, which does not facilitate clarity of reporting in this respect. Furthermore, strategy and value creation inevitably include matters of commercial sensitivity and of interest to competitors or regulators, which may be difficult to address by providing the right and balanced level ",

Despite such difficult aspects, the ACCA report notes that some organisations claimed that their reporting had evolved and improved by responding to feedback from stakeholders.For the 2019 ACT report, the assessment of the reporting of a sample of 1 000 companies has considered the presentation of business model disclosures both from a cross-sectoral as well as a sector specific perspective. The 2019 ACT report notes that the cross-sectoral perspective is useful to map the issues companies consider from a strategic perspective, even though materiality of a sustainability issue for any company depends on the company\u2019s sector and operational context. It also notes that on the other hand, the sector-specific overviews offer insights into the level of strategic awareness among companies of sustainability risks and impacts which are clearly associated with their sector. The overall results of the ACT assessment show that strategic disclosures are not common. The comparison with thematic results presented in various sections of the 2019 ACT report further indicate that there is a significant number of companies which provide information on their policies, risks, outcomes, and KPIs, but not on strategic, business model-related information.The diagram in Figure 34 below presents one example of the findings from the 2019 ACT report for sectors that are highly exposed to climate-related risks and for which reporting on these risks from a business model perspective can be reasonably expected to be high.Figure 34: Reporting of climate-related risks for sectors that are highly exposed to such risksSource: An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, Alliance for Corporate Transparency (2019) \u2013 page 38Another example, Apparel & Textiles companies and Food & Beverages companies that mostly rely on outsourced production located in regions with systemic human rights and natural resources abuse, including labour conditions and deforestation. Yet, the findings presented in Figure 35 show that only 10 30% of these companies report on these issues from a business-model perspective.Figure 35: Reporting by companies in sectors relying on outsourced production located in regions with systemic risksSource: An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, Alliance for Corporate Transparency (2019) \u2013 page 38A third example, financial companies are connected through their investment or lending activities with all types of sustainability impacts. The diagram in Figure 36 shows the extent to which they consider the related risks and impacts strategically important for their business models.Figure 36: Extent, to which financial companies consider sustainability related risks and impacts as strategically important for their business models \u2026Source: An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, Alliance for Corporate Transparency (2019) \u2013 page 38Reporting of quantitative goals and targets as well as data to track progressThere are several different definitions for the types of metrics presented by a company and used by an investor. There is no common nor correct way to define a number of these items, as they can vary between companies and investors, and even within those organisations.Performance metrics include both financial and wider metrics. Financial metrics are those that are derived based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u2018GAAP\u2019), as well as those that incorporate financial information, but which are not the same as those measured under GAAP, e.g. adjusted EBITDA, operating earnings and free cash flows.200 Many non-financial metrics are expressed in non-monetary units, e.g. employee engagement results, brand awareness/customer satisfaction scores, market share or environmental measures, which can either be standardised or company specific. However, due to a lack of a clear framework or defined metrics for reporting, there are a number of challenges both in comparing organisations with one another but also in monitoring and tracking year on year performance within individual organisations, as approaches to non-financial reporting can vary from one year to the next.In addition to the above, there are clear difficulties in the quantification of impacts, including the inconsistent methods for taking into account non-financial information stemming from an organisation\u2019s supply chains (see section on reporting boundaries).202 The examination of the sustainability reports of the 1 000 largest companies in Europe for the 2019 ACT report, noted the weakness of companies in reporting quantitative goals and targets, as well as data to track progress:a) 22% of companies presented sustainability indicators in summary form, in stark contrast to the way financial metrics are disclosed.b) 14% of companies reported on how they align their climate-change targets with the Paris Agreement goals or with the SDGs, and measure their progress accordingly. It appears that most companies need to improve their reporting on targets on climate change, with specific risk mitigation strategies.c) On social issues, companies in the research were too often conflating social goals with treatment of employees.d) Strategic information on the integration of sustainability in the governance of companies was often missed, as the NFRD does not explicitly require such disclosures.e) The clarity of reporting is often affected by the lack of homogeneity in the frameworks used, and in the presentation of KPIs which are often scattered across the narrative.In addition to the examination of the specificity of company climate change policies, the analysis for the 2019 ACT report assessed whether company reports describe concrete targets related to climate change mitigation. The analysis considered only targets linked to the primary impact companies can effectively mitigate. Interestingly, only 36.4% of companies from the Energy & Resource Extraction sector report on climate-related targets. Companies from the Financial sector are those disclosing climate related targets the least (20.5%), which is worrying, given the sector\u2019s important role in contributing to the low-carbon transition. With regards to information on science-based targets, numbers recorded are even lower. From a cross-sectoral perspective, only 13.9% of companies disclose relevant data. Even in high scoring sectors, less than 30% of companies report relevant data (Energy & Resource Extraction sector at 23.5%).Figure 37: Analysis of whether company reports describe concrete targets related to climate change mitigationSource: An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, Alliance for Corporate Transparency (2019) \u2013 page 16Risksthe analysis of the reporting of 1 000 companies for the 2019 ACT report showed that there is a lack of maturity especially for disclosure on climate-related scenarios used to inform company strategies (6.6%). In this respect, sector differences are striking. While 22% of companies in the Energy sector report on climate-related scenarios aligned with 1.5\u00b0C or well below 2\u00b0C, just over 2% in the Infrastructure provide sufficient information (2.6%). With regards to the Finance sector, in addition to data in the overview below, very few organisations are specific about the exposure of their lending, investment and underwriting activities to sectors contributing to climate change (13.4%) or provide an estimation of the exposure of assets (financial, non-financial, under management) or the value of collaterals to climate-related risks (3.1%).Figure 38: Extent to which companies in the most exposed sectors report information corresponding to specific TCFD criteriaSource: An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, Alliance for Corporate Transparency (2019) \u2013 page 17205 With regards to specific metrics, the analysis of the reporting of 1 000 companies for the 2019 ACT report showed a relatively good image when considering the disclosures of highly polluting sectors. When looking at companies in the Energy & Resource Extraction, Infrastructure, Resource Transformation and Transportation sectors, Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions are disclosed by 76.6% (87.1% in the Energy & Resource Extraction) and 60.7% respectively. Lower values are observed in the case of Scope 3 emissions, where an average of 35% of all companies disclose such type of data. Even in high-impact sectors such as Apparel & Textiles and Food & Beverages, a majority of companies do not provide information on Scope 3 emissions (62.7% and 71.6% respectively). Of those that do, only a small fraction report on emission targets. GHG intensity indicators were reported by 29.8%, 13.4% and 5% for Scope 1, 2 and 3 respectively.206 The CDSB 2018 review of 80 European companies\u2019 annual reports found that companies have been able to disclose decision-useful information in line with the NFRD, however in some cases environmental targets/goals lack corresponding KPIs to show performance and progress towards them. The 2019 report critique for the IIRC by ACCA notes that most of the concerns raised by preparers of integrated reports in line with the IIRC Framework, were the problems they had in measuring and quantifying the impact on the different capitals, especially the environmental and social outcomes of their business. At times they struggled to find indicators that really reflected the value-creation process and others lacked practical value. Some preparers therefore discussed the impacts in a qualitative way. Others were ambitious and tried not only to quantify but also to monetise the impacts. Some traced the issue back to the business model in showing how the organisation uses or affects the various capitals. 208 The IIRC Framework expects that the report should record performance and progress towards strategic objectives. However, in the review by ACCA for the 2019 report critique, this aspect achieved average relative scores and was disappointing given that the information about strategic targets and performance must be readily available and would be of particular interest to providers of financial capital and most other stakeholders. 209 In the 2019 sample of 48 reports reviewed by ACCA, only 36% provided targets for the identified KPIs in full, 43% only for some and 21% provided no targets for any of their KPIs.ConnectivityA 2020 EY Climate Change and Sustainability Services (CCaSS) Institutional Investor survey, conducted on a sample of 300 institutional investors globally, noted that among the top five challenges of investors regarding the usefulness and effectiveness of ESG reporting, is the disconnect between ESG reporting and mainstream financial information.The 2020 report of the European Lab Project Task Force on climate-related reporting, that reviewed the reporting of approximately 150 companies from Europe and beyond, noted that the various relevant sections of companies\u2019 reports are not always clearly articulated or well-connected to allow getting a complete picture of companies\u2019 approaches to assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. It also noted that climate-related reporting is not always included in companies\u2019 financial filings, but can often be found in other company documents. Consequently, it is sometimes difficult for users of corporate reports to understand how climate risks are evaluated and managed within the company, and who is responsible.The connectivity between financial and non-financial information is crucial. Through corporate reporting, organisations can communicate their individual story based on their business and value creation models. By doing so, some of the criticism over the ability of financial reporting to meet the needs of key stakeholders could be overcome.Bias towards quantification should be avoided, as narrative reporting is powerful and can provide relevant information and insights beyond the numerical facts.",

        "text": "Certainly, online and digital reporting platforms have the potential to link non-financial reports to other reports and provide cross-references between different parts. Technology can get ahead of regulation, which in some cases restricts the formats in which reporting can be done.The CDSB 2018 review of 80 European companies\u2019 annual reports found that companies have been able to disclose decision-useful information in line with the NFRD, however:a) Many do not make the connection between the information disclosed. For example, a report may describe environmental policies, without explaining the company\u2019s strategies to implement them;b) Coherent and connected reporting demonstrates the relationships between vision, mission, risks, policies, strategies, targets and KPIs. Reporting however is not always easy to navigate, read and search. This is important to aid user understanding.Connectivity seems to be a principle with which some companies struggle. The 2019 report critique for the IIRC by ACCA notes that some users seem to interpret the IIRC Framework as specifically the interconnection between the different capitals and how investment and good performance for one may positively or negatively affect others.The IIRC Framework states the objective of connectivity as follows: \u2018An integrated report should show a holistic picture of the combination, interrelatedness and dependencies between the factors that affect the organisation\u2019s ability to create value over time\u2019. It considers that there should be connectivity in different forms, including between: content elements, the past, present and future, the six capitals, financial and other information, quantitative and qualitative information, information for management and that reported externally. There may be a disconnect between non-financial indicators and financial ones because of time lags between them. In the same way, output measures may be ahead of outcome measures.The issue of connectivity was also highlighted by respondents to the research on stakeholder perceptions of non-financial reporting conducted by BEIS in 2019. Below are some relevant comments from respondents to this research:a) \u2018There is a glaring disconnect between trends and risks discussed in the strategic report and key accounting assumptions and estimates used in the accounts themselves.\u2019 ClientEarthb) A respondent highlighted the number of reports required, from a strategic report through to a directors\u2019 report, which means that reporting can get quite silo-ed. c) \u2018There are lots of different pieces which, either through tradition, legislation or regulation have to be disclosed somewhere. However, it doesn\u2019t lead to a document which has a natural start, middle and end, which people can see and be told the story. It becomes quite broken up and I think that the legislation has made this worse rather than made it better.\u2019 Companies AllianceReporting impactsAccording to the 2019 ACT report that analysed the reporting of a sample of 1 000 companies, the NFRD\u2019s firm intent to link \u2018policies, risks and results\u2019 together in the reporting, is falling short, with most reporting entities disclosing inputs rather than outcomes. The absence of \u2018impact\u2019 in the reporting demands urgent attention both in reporting companies and in the revision of the NFRD itself.220 The 2019 ACT report notes that this issue is further accentuated by the fact the companies continue to use non-financial reporting as a means of marketing and providing \u2018boiler plate\u2019 disclosures that do not mean much.On climate change, 82% of companies have policies, but only 35% have targets and even fewer \u2013 28% \u2013 report on their outcome.",

        "text": "Despite the controversies about data privacy and cyber security, 84% of ICT companies report data protection policies, but only 8% describe outcomes in terms of meeting policy targets.Even where there are targets, this does not mean they are meaningful. The major extractives company in the sample analysed for the 2019 ACT report, that sets its objective as \u2018the wellbeing of our people, the community and the environment is considered in everything that we do,\u2019 discloses \u2018warm words\u2019 rather than concrete targets, which are espoused in too much of today\u2019s reporting.The 2019 ACT report further notes that the problem of a failure to address concrete issues, targets and principal risks, remains largely unchanged between the 2018 and 2019 research cycles carried out by the Alliance for Corporate Transparency.Of the 105 companies in the Energy, ICT and Health Care sectors analysed in both years, there was actually a reduction in the number of companies reporting specific issues and targets on climate change, a similar decrease in the number of business partners covered by human rights risk statements and a marked increase in companies that chose to give no information at all about the general structure and risks of their supply chain (from 51 to 70 companies).Data on universally or nearly universally applicable topics, namely climate change, employee and social matters, human rights, and anti-corruption, show that only a minority of companies provide information specific enough to understand company policies. This minority is stronger regarding climate change and employee matter disclosures (34.5% and 43.1% respectively), than for human rights (21.9%) and anti-corruption (19.7%). These numbers drop, especially for climate change, in the analysis of quality of disclosure of risks as well as policy outcomes in terms of targets set by the company. As the 2019 ACT report points out, this suggests firstly that while many companies, albeit still a minority, disclose fairly detailed policies, significantly fewer companies provide information which is necessary to understand their situation and future development. The analysis of detailed qualitative criteria in the 2019 ACT report shows that the actual number of meaningful disclosures is even lower. Secondly, the 2019 ACT report notes that for each category the number of companies reporting on individual sustainability issues is significantly higher than that of companies providing specific information on risks and implementations of their policies. This implies that the topic is either not material, and thus should ideally not be included in the disclosure of such companies, or that it is indeed material, but companies fail to provide material information. Thirdly, always according to the 2019 ACT report, the results imply poor connectivity between the disclosures of individual categories of information. The detailed analysis in the 2019 ACT report confirms such a problem, and further points at weaknesses in how companies report on the integration of non-financial information with their overall strategies.Figure 39: Reporting practices with respect to different sustainability issuesSource: An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, Alliance for Corporate Transparency (2019) \u2013 pages 14 and 15Positive impacts by products and services and sources of opportunity230 According to the 2019 ACT report, based on the sample of 1 000 analysed, there is a gap between the proportion of companies reporting on strategies and initiatives for climate change, other environmental issues and social/ community matters (33.8%, 30.7% and 26.8% respectively), and those disclosing relevant and decision-useful information around such strategies. This is the case when looking at corporate disclosure on the turnover from products or services addressing sustainability challenges for these matters (5.8%, 4.9% and 3% respectively), and data on investment in the associated described strategies (9.4%, 7.2% and 7.9% respectively). Reporting on this is key if companies are to be transparent and provide investors with information about the sustainable activities they engage in, in line with the (future) requirements of the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities.Figure 40: Companies reporting on strategies or initiatives around products or services that focus on sustainable development opportunitiesSource: An analysis of the sustainability reports of 1 000 companies pursuant to the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, Alliance for Corporate Transparency (2019) \u2013 page 94Long-term value creationTo be of value, corporate data must show companies\u2019 long-term value creation. The outlook facing the business and the challenges and uncertainties likely to arise in pursuing its strategy are of great interest to stakeholders. This is an area where reports could be improved.A report by PwC in 2016 \u2018A foot in the past and an eye to the future\u2019, addresses the importance of forward-looking information in company reporting and presents trends and practices based on the review of the 2015 reporting of 52 FTSE 350 companies.

The EY report quotes an investor saying \u2018it\u2019s one thing for a company to report its ESG achievements over the past 6 months, 12 months, or 3 to 5 years, but we\u2019d like to see what that will look like 20 or 30 years in the future\u2019.The Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism and EY brought together 31 companies, asset managers and asset owners, to identify new metrics to measure and articulate long-term value to investors and other stakeholders \u2013 the Embankment Project for Inclusive Capitalism (EPIC). EPIC published a report in 2018. This report stresses that for a company to effectively measure and articulate its long-term value creation potential, a framework is necessary that combines a broader view on value creation beyond financials, with a broader stakeholder perspective and long-term orientation. It also states that although many of the existing frameworks may cover one or two of these aspects across a defined field, such as human or natural capital, none of them are sufficiently comprehensive.The 2019 report critique for the IIRC by ACCA highlights that during their 2018 reviews they explored with some preparers the management\u2019s perception of the outlook facing the business and what challenges and uncertainties are likely to arise in pursuing its strategy. It notes, that most interviewed preparers argued that although liability concerns should not hold back reporting of future prospects, there is concern that by discussing possible actions, reporting entities may be seen as committed to them and that the discussion should avoid any cases where talking about risk situations might heighten their likelihood. It also notes that some companies might find discussing the outlook in their integrated report easier than others, because they must produce a forward plan for their regulator.Exposure to risksTo be of value, corporate data must show companies\u2019 exposure to risks. As the regulatory framework of the European Green Deal comes into play, companies will face higher regulatory risks if they do not reduce their environmental impact. The NFRD should call for more accurate and comprehensive reporting of risks and opportunities linked to climate, the environment and social aspects.The 2019 report critique for the IIRC by ACCA concluded that in order to understand strategy, performance and prospects, it is crucial that an integrated report assesses the risks to which the organisation is exposed. This comes out as an area of relative strength in reports reviewed by ACCA over a period of four years, identifying the risks that could affect value creation over the shorter and longer term and how the company was mitigating them. Companies have got more accustomed over recent years to discussing risks, not only via the IIRC framework but also as required by regulation or accounting standards. On the other hand, some reports were less forthcoming about the opportunities that also presented themselves. This seems aligned with the requirements of investors and other providers of financial capital, who often seem more interested in understanding risks than perceived opportunities. In addition, opportunities may have more commercial sensitivity.The abovementioned ACCA report notes that in the interviews they carried out for the 2018 reviews, as regards opportunities, some of the preparing companies cited both less investor interest in them and commercial competitive concerns. There were also issues about overpromising investors about the potential of opportunities. These companies claimed that readers expected some degree of prudence and restraint and that this aided credibility. Some banks, for example, assessed and reported risk and opportunities together when discussing the different issues faced by the business.",

While we found 165 cases explicitly refer to annual reports (or components thereof such as management discussion & analysis, directors\u2019 report or governance report) and 80 cases that mention sustainability or non-financial reports, our latest data also includes 175 cases where nothing is specified and 42 cases where specific reference is made to data disclosures and statements.Other disclosure vehicles referred to include thematic reports, plans and online disclosure. The diverse nature of these specifications possibly calls for some standardization, for example consideration by regulators of what specifications are most effective and efficient in the digital age. Greater interest in data and the format in which data is communicated need to address ongoing concerns related to the reliability, comparability and timeframe of data disclosed. Reporting format or type also need to consider the specific user audience addressed and their information needs.\u2019Source: Carrots & Sticks \u2013 Sustainability reporting policy: Global trends in disclosure as the ESG agenda , GRI and University of Stellenbosch Business School (2020) \u2013 page 31Figure 42Source: Carrots & Sticks \u2013 Sustainability reporting policy: Global trends in disclosure as the ESG agenda , GRI and University of Stellenbosch Business School (2020) \u2013 page 31Ultimately, the Carrots & Sticks 2020 report concludes that \u2018it is unclear whether recommendation of disclosure venue by regulators effectively consider the user target audience\u2019.The 2017 Frank Bold paper comparing the implementation of the NFRD in the UK, Germany, Italy and France, concludes Quote 2\u2018Of the four jurisdictions considered in this paper (UK, France, Germany and Italy), only the UK and France have gone beyond the requirements of the Directive to require the non-financial information statement to be included in the annual management report (rather than either being included in the annual management report, or being prepared as a separate report). The requirement for inclusion in the annual management report gives gravity and prominence to the non-financial reporting statement, which is circulated to shareholders on a yearly basis ahead of the general meeting. This also improves the integration of financial and non-financial reporting which can be seen as a positive step.Conversely, in Germany, if the non-financial information statement is not included in the annual management report, it can be published on the company\u2019s website up to four months afterwards, provided that the annual management report refers to this publication and the website. This time lag means that a number of shareholders whose attention is captured for the purposes of reviewing the annual management report and preparing for the annual meeting, may be lost, and that the information will therefore not be given the same level of attention. BASF (a German chemical company), Deutsche Bank and Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG have all said that providing information in a separate report is a step backwards.\u2019Source: Comparing the implementation of the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive in the UK, Germany, France and Italy, Frank Bold (2017) \u2013 page 3A survey conducted by EY on a sample of 300 institutional investors globally highlights some of the challenges in non-financial reporting and includes the disconnect between ESG reporting and mainstream financial information as one of the top five issues affecting the usefulness and effectiveness of ESG reporting. The TCFD recommendations ask for disclosures to be made in financial filings, alongside other financial disclosures. According to the EY Global Climate Risk Disclosure Barometer, this element of the TCFD recommendations is yet to be widely implemented. Some companies did include relevant climate-related disclosures within the annual report as part of a discussion on the business strategy in the directors\u2019 report or within the operating and financial review (which includes a description of the future prospects of the business). However, the overwhelming majority provided relevant climate-related disclosures within separate non-financial reports, sustainability reports or their Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) reporting. EY notes that despite the call in the TCFD recommendations, there are several reasons why most companies have not taken the step to include disclosures in their annual reports or directors\u2019 reports. The relative immaturity of processes to capture and report on climate change risks is likely to be one reason, as well as the difficulty in setting timeframes on the potential implications of either transition or physical climate-related risks. It can also be difficult to translate these risks into financial implications. However, shareholder resolutions, enforcement of listing rules and regulator focus is likely to force companies to change this in upcoming reporting periods.Technology",

Regulatory authorities incur costs for publishing, administering, monitoring, and enforcing regulations, including the costs of:a) Developing and implementing licensing or registration systems;b) Assessing and approving applications;c) Processing renewals;d) Implementing inspection or auditing systems; ande) Implementing systems for sanctions for noncompliance.The fragmentation regarding technology is classified under six headings below. The information provided is sourced from the report published by IMA in 2020 entitled \u2018A digital transformation brief: Business reporting in the fourth industrial revolution\u2019 and supporting research.Non-financial data processesThe flows and interfaces between input, throughput, and output across various systems are not aligned and often require manual intervention to ensure that the output of one system is reprocessed in the necessary format to be validated for submission to the next system. It is further connected to multiple output reports, where the need to ensure a single source of truth is essential. For example, the data from a regulated entity\u2019s enterprise resource planning (ERP) software needs to be compiled and repackaged in order to meet a regulator\u2019s \u2018form\u2019 and \u2018data format\u2019 requirements for filing submissions. Seamless integration between these internal and external interfaces depends on codified standards for data generation, validation, and sharing.Data typesThis is the most common area of fragmentation. Data held in an ERP system consists of one type, which often must be converted into a different type in order to be transmitted into another system. Different regulators require the same information in their specific formats or data types. Surprisingly, some individual regulators call for the same information in different forms and in different data formats. The assembling, dismantling, and repackaging of data in the required format can cause compliance issues and unintentional information errors when filing. Adoption of common codified standards for machine-readable data creation and exchange across all stakeholders within the compliance ecosystem could result in a giant leap toward coherence in the data flow.Standards and supporting documentsRegulators adopt unique standards, data definitions, and business validation rules for similar non-financial data elements and metrics. A lack of cohesion in standards across regulators results in higher entity and regulatory costs in terms of time and resources. It also weakens auditability of information disseminated to a multitude of regulators and increases risks due to increased subjectivity, differences in interpretations, misinformation, and inadvertent partial compliance or non-compliance.Technical standardsDifferent regulators have different access controls, validation rules, and data format specifications. These differences increase the complexity within a compliance ecosystem.",

In a March 2017 report, the European Federation of Accountants and Auditors for SMEs (EFAA) analysed the trickle-down effect in financial reporting. This survey covered Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the UK. Preparers were asked to identify and provide details of the application (or not) to SMEs of what were judged the main (not all) accounting treatments in full IFRS. The EFAA report concludes \u2018that the impact of \u2018trickle down\u2019 is significant in all five countries. In all cases, convergence (\u2026) of SME accounting with IFRS is at least 57% and the countries fall into a relatively narrow range of between 57% for Germany and the Netherlands, and 72% for the UK. All show clear signs that \u2018trickle down\u2019 has been a major factor in producing that convergence (ranging from 33% in the Netherlands to 59% in Portugal). It should be noted that distinguishing whether a current treatment derived from IFRS or from pre-existing practice can be a difficult matter to judge, in some cases. Difference in country ranges arise from specific actions taken by individual countries.It is also observed that the extent of \u2018trickle down\u2019 is clearly greater for larger SMEs.Figure 43: Extent of financial reporting standards trickle-down for SMEsSource: The Trickle Down Effect \u2013 IFRS and accounting by SMEs, EFAA (2017) \u2013 page 5266 The EFAA report further concludes \u2018Having concluded that the largest SMEs were most likely to have \u2018trickle down\u2019, a more detailed analysis of the medium-sized entities was carried out to ascertain what other conclusions might be drawn. The following factors were noted:a) More \u2018trickle down\u2019 is likely in areas where the Accounting Directive is silent, because national GAAP will tend to use IFRS where that is so (\u2026)",

However, this trickle-down effect would certainly be a less coordinated one compared to proper regulatory requirements for non-financial reporting towards SMEs.Location",

Key stakeholders such as corporate clients that are introducing sustainability and transparency requirements in their supply chain, are also exercising pressure in this field (see also section above about the trickle-down effect). Those SMEs that cannot meet such requests due to insufficient human and financial resources, are penalised in terms of market access. Furthermore, with the increase in requests for non-financial information from investors or other finance providers, linked to new regulatory obligations, these SMEs could be denied access to finance.Information reported by SMEs is often scattered across various documents, some of which are not accessible to the public. SMEs do not use the reporting tools used and developed for big corporations.

        "text": "The most significant and salient observations and assessment points of Stream A6 are identified and described below, including articulation of their relevance and importance in the perspective of possible non-financial standard setting.The large and increasing number of reporting requirements and frameworks, together with their heterogeneity (in scope, objective, implementation \u2013 voluntary or mandatory, technology, etc), are a source of numerous inconsistencies in reporting practices, ultimately failing to address users\u2019 needs while being a burden for preparers of non-financial information, whose specificities and capacities (from large companies to SMEs) are not sufficiently considered.Despite their increasing number, reporting provisions pursuing different objectives for different users fail to provide consistent guidance about what information to report (scope, breadth, depth), how and where. In this context of high complexity, companies are unsure whether they provide non-financial information that would be considered of good quality by users while at the same time being relevant to their main impacts, risks or policies. Users, on the other hand, struggle to locate and sometimes make sense of the reported data. This situation is further complicated by the lack of uniform requirements for monitoring of compliance and independent verification of the data.Mirroring the fast-growing number and diversity of reporting provisions, non-financial disclosures have significantly increased in a somewhat unfocused manner. An increasing amount of non-financial data is disclosed in a variety of different places outside of the annual report or sustainability report via external links and complementary online content (investor briefs, press releases, newsletters, websites, etc). This makes it difficult for users to find decision-useful information and introduces uncertainty about whether the provided information is different between the different formats. The diversity of disclosure formats also makes it difficult for users to assess the relevance, comparability and reliability of the disclosed information.The focus and momentum on environmental related matters both at policy level and in reporting frameworks is reflected in the efforts and focus put on reporting about climate or other environmental issues. In comparison, information given about other topics of interest to users seem to be less developed and elaborate.Different reporting provisions put different emphasis on reporting of actual data compared to providing information on progress over time, on outcomes and impact, and/or on providing a forward-looking perspective. Existing provisions appear to rather focus on documentation and reporting per se, instead of driving real action. Consequently, reporting entities\u2019 efforts tend to be directed at describing policies rather than focusing on the impacts of such policies and highlighting the link between risks, policies and impacts. Although reporting increasingly includes references to the Paris Agreement or global policy priorities the extent of reporting specific targets to measure progress is limited (e.g. failure to report on targets on climate change, and measurement of actions to manage human right risks). This may be explained by challenges in the quantification of some of the topics (especially social issues), the lack of standardised metrics and the lack of maturity in the systems and processes which support the generation of this information.Non-financial reporting provisions currently tend to focus on large and listed companies, meaning that some users\u2019 needs are not met. In this regard, the situation of SMEs that are part of the supply and value chain of companies subject to mandatory non-financial reporting is a challenging one. Existing reporting requirements have not been tailored to consider their limited resources and capacities, making their contribution to the overall non-financial reporting objectives a source of problems both for them and for the multitude of stakeholders that wish to use their data and information. Specific consideration on how to include SMEs in the non-financial reporting landscape at a reasonable cost and effort for them appears to be missing. 280 Beyond SMEs, preparers of all sizes are pointing at the difficulty of finding the right balance between satisfying the needs of a broad universe of users (having very different perspectives, expectations and therefore needs) and their own reporting needs, while keeping reporting costs at a reasonable level. In addition, while asking for clarification about a non-financial reporting target structure, all preparers are also expressing the need for a proportionate approach to a staged implementation based on a proper cost/benefit analysis.From a digitisation perspective, the non-financial reporting ecosystem is diversified in many ways, inflating costs, creating operational and compliance risks, and ultimately hampering access:a) Regulators apply their own standards, data definitions (if any) and validation rules for similar non-financial data elements and metrics. In the EU currently there is no digital taxonomy of non-financial data allowing for efficient and consistent access to such non-financial data (except for Spain, although even the Spanish taxonomy is used little in practice).b) The lack of cohesion in standards and (digital) taxonomy, results in higher entity and regulatory costs in terms of time and resources. It also weakens the auditability of information and increases risks due to increased subjectivity, differences in interpretations, misinformation, and inadvertent partial compliance or non-compliance. Also, the assembling, dismantling, and repackaging of data in the required format can cause compliance issues and unintentional information errors when filing.c) Same inconsistencies and insufficiencies apply to access controls, validation rules and data format specifications. These differences and gaps increase the complexity and challenge the usefulness of a compliance ecosystem.d) The flows and interfaces between input, throughput and output across various systems are not aligned and often require manual intervention to ensure that the output of one system is reprocessed in the necessary format to be validated for submission to the next system.e) Modes of information submission differ for different forms and types of information.",
