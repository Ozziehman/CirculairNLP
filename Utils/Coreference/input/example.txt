In 2018, Ceva adopted its Code of Ethics and Good Conduct 
and prepared its first CSR report  The following year, the 
Group implemented a system to ensure the security of per-
sonal data in order to achieve compliance with the General 
Personal Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  
In early 2020, Ceva performed an initial analysis of its 
non-financial risks, considering their impact on its business 
activity and on its stakeholders, and the probability of their 
occurrence  The Group prepared its first non-financial per-
formance statement for the 2019 financial year in 2020, 
presenting the policies and procedures in place to identify, 
prevent, and reduce the impact of its non-financial risks  
Ceva has also improved its approach to the definition and 
reporting of performance indicators  Several performance 
indicators were thus published in the 2020 report, and the 
structural work for its all-risk approach is ongoing 
2020: Ceva conducts its CSR transition in the 
context of the Covid-19 crisis
The year 2020 was marked by the pandemic, and the actions 
taken by Ceva to protect employees and their families and 
make its contribution to regional social welfare programs  
The crisis put the Groupâ€™s values into action, and gave rise 
to profound cross-sector cooperation among the teams  
This unprecedented situation also accelerated certain 
transformations that Ceva had already embarked upon  
For example, certain changes to working methods required 
for health security also contributed to strengthening our
culture of independence and responsibility  Among the 
other major advances that were made in 2020, Ceva also 
strengthened the governance of its animal welfare policy, 
working toward creating a charter and assembling a 
network of dedicated managers   
It was a year of transition, one that thrust Ceva into the 
post-pandemic world, 2020 became the first financial 
year for which the Group published its key non-financial 
performance indicators and its carbon footprint for scopes 
1 and 2: the values thus obtained now form the benchmark 
for the achievement and expansion of the objectives that 
Ceva has set itself, and for the progress to be made in the 
years to come.
