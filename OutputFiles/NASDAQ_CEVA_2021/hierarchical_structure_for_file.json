To support this ambition, we have joined the UN Global Compact's \"Race to Zero\" and are committed to achieving net-zero by 2050.While the world continues to live at the pace of the pandemic, the global economy's strong reco-very has led to an increase in trade, resulting in the growth of our business. Despite the difficult circumstances, our employees have shown exem-plary commitment and I would like to thank them for this.  Our Foundation, which represents the Group's spirit of solidarity, has continued its initiatives to promote education for everyone. We created the social innovation incubator \"Le Phare\" in Marseille. We continued to respond to huma-nitarian emergencies by providing aid to popu-lations in distress and pursued our solidarity actions, particularly in Lebanon.   Throughout the year, we have accelerated our CSR strategy:  we have strengthened the three pillars on which it is based: acting for planet, people and fair trade. And we support the ini-tiatives and ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact. Our CSR policy is at the heart of our strategy. In addition to our economic footprint, we now consi-der our social, societal and environmental foot-print in every decision we make.To take just a few examples:Our objective is clear: to be an exemplary stakeholder in global supply chains. With our size, our position at the heart of world trade, our pioneering and entrepreneurial spirit, we can and we want to lead our clients, our partners and our entire sector towards a virtuous dynamic.",

The taxonomy will allow the EU to define which activities will be considered environmentally sustainable and also to  benchmark companies. For CMA CGM Group, the first step will be to define which activities are eligible before determining their alignment, based on the technical criteria published by the European Union. CMA CGM Group, a family-owned, unlisted company, will have to publish information in 2023, to determine the share of economic activities eligible under the green taxonomy.

By 2024, our fleet will have at least 44 LNG-powered vessels. This new equipment will enable the use of renewable energies to propel our vessels (gases such as biomethane and synthetic methane). To make this decarbonization strategy a reality, the Group is also investing in the production of biomethane and setting up strategic partnerships with its suppliers.Convinced that decarbonization of the Group requires a mix of solutions, we are investing in research and development (R&D) to design the clean vessels of the future and are working to continuously improve the performance of our assets.",

At the same time, we are making progress on other alternative energies such as electricity and green hydrogen for our other needs (quay equipment, cranes or machinery). New technologies will also allow us to optimise our operations and thus reduce our consumption to a minimum. We already do this with the help of algorithms that allow us to adapt the route of our ships or optimise their loading. To limit our consumption, we also invest significantly in the engineering of our ships. We are developing innovative designs that will take to the sea in a few months. \u00bb",

Waste emissions from chartered ves-sels are estimated from the emissions of owned vessels, pro-rata to the twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) km.Scope 3 emissions come from the construction of ships and containers, the production of waste (solid and liquid) from ships, business travel by employees, the consumption of fuel for land transport and the upstream phase of production and transport of the fuel The data does not take into account the natural gas consumption of the United States.

We multiply this factor by the number of passengers in the reference year and by the ADEME emission factor of 0.083 kg COe/passenger for long-distance travel. emissions CEVA Logistics:Shipbuilding: The impact is calculated from the carbon dioxide emissions from the production of the steel nee-ded to build the ships, measured based on the weight of steel in the ships (emission factor of 2.21). We take into account the average number of ships produced over 5 years. Emissions from construction sites are unknown at present but are assumed to be negligible. Emissions from chartered vessels are estimated from the emissions of owned vessels, pro-rata by twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU).SOx emissions cover the entire operated fleet. They are calculated based on fuel oil consumption per type of fuel oil and the maximum mandatory limit of sulphur content per type of fuel oil. Sulphur emissions from scrubbers are not included in the total SOx emissions.Nox emissions Maritime activity: CEVA Logistics reports warehouses & trucks energies consumption and associated CO emissions scope 1 and 2  \u2013  NOx emissions cover the entire operated fleet.

The scope covers business in the fol-lowing countries: Germany, India, Turkey, United King-dom, United States, Canada, and South Africa (covers 88% of our truck fleet). Other countries have been excluded as they do not operate truck fleets. Lebanon is currently out of scope but will be included next year.Container construction: Emissions from container manufacturing are estimated from the number of containers refurbished each year and converted to raw stainless steel (2.2 tonnes of steel per container).
