Nearly 90% of our profits were reinvested in our Group to enable us to grow, to ensure we remain resilient, to accelerate our energy transition but also to make  a positive contribution.On the environmental front, we continued to renew our fleet and modernise our ships. Since 2020, over 10 billion dollars have been spent on these efforts and, as a result, by 2027 we will have  a fleet of over 100 ships powered by lower-carbon intensity fuels. To accelerate our move towards decarbonising the full range of our activities and to assist the transition of our sector, last year  we created a Fund for Energies with a five-year endowment of 1.5 billion euros. A group like ours also has a duty to provide assistance to the most vulnerable populations.  Last year once again, our Foundation was exemplary: it enabled the delivery of nearly 10 million meals and the transport of 8,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid to 34 countries around the world, and helped tens of thousands of children in need. In addition, several large-scale humanitarian operations were organised in conjunction with the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs to assist  the Ukrainian population affected by the ongoing war. Finally, we have chosen to show our appreciation to our staff for their outstanding job in 2022  by rewarding them with over 700 million dollars in bonus and pay rise.",

        "text": "TerminalsCMA CGM continuously renews its safety awareness resources for seafarers. In connection with its process for sharing feedback about onboard events, the Group uses tools such as comic books to reach less experienced crew members. CEVA Logistics\u2019 health and safety policy is deployed at all levels of the company, and all employees are committed to actively contribute to achieving  its objectives. CEVA Logistics has built its safety management culture around three levels of responsibility:The risk mapping of shore-based, logistics and terminal activities has identified 10 Critical Risk Standards (CRS): natural disasters, fires and explosions, collisions, cargo handling, falls from heights, the environment, ships and inland transport, maintenance/energy, security, occupational health and safety.- site level: operational control and risk management; CEVA Logistics- regional level: facilitation and technical support;-  global level: definition of strategy and objectives, systems management and support for certification.Safety management is integrated into TOUCH, our fleet management tool. The record of daily operations aboard vessels is used to share feedback on a weekly basis about accidents that have occurred and actions and practices to be encouraged. In order to harmonise and improve health and safety practices, the risk analysis and incident reporting tool was simplified and digitalised in 2022.In 2022, the Group launched its \"Heading to Safety\" safety awareness campaign, which focuses on the 12 golden behavioural rules for maximising safety in partner shipyards: wearing personal protective equipment, risk analysis, prevention attitudes and good practices, and the use of tools. Each site applies a management approach to these 10 critical risks, is covered by a prevention and control method, and is equipped with the necessary tools  to prepare an action plan adapted to local, regulatory, environmental and operational specificities.  An incident reporting and analysis mobile application provides the transparency and responsiveness required when a risk materialises. The sites establish a safety culture and raise awareness among their employees through a dedicated safety talks called the \"Toolbox Meeting\".All new employees and subcontractors receive safety training. Sites with over 10 employees have Health, Safety and Environment Committees.  Site managers conduct a safety inspection of their sites each month. Workplace accidents, illnesses and incidents are systematically investigated,  the cause is identified and corrective action is taken to avoid any recurrence. The weekly safety report shares good practices and the analysis of significant events in order to improve the safety culture. A monthly report includes safety initiatives, as well as environmental initiatives,  site performance updates and accident reports, thus providing an overview of the achievements of the terminals and shore-based sites to further  the continuous improvement process. CEVA Logistics is currently digitising the monitoring of workplace safety using the Intelex solution.  This tool will make it possible to target more precisely the sites identified as the most accident-prone with dedicated action plans and to better control major risks. Initially deployed in the United Kingdom, starting in 2023, Intelex will be progressively extended to  the other countries in which the Group does business. In 2022, the Group extended to site managers and safety officers its \"Leadership in Safety\" training course, which was given last year to onboard officers. The \"Leadership in Safety\" training was rolled out in 2022 to HSE managers and directors of terminal and inland sites. ",

This covers recruitment, training, coaching and the creation of peer-to-peer discussion periods focused on sharing experiences, strengthening commitment and increasing skills.  An internal recruitment event, \"Trainers Wanted\", was organised at the head office this year. -  strengthen the CMA CGM network and form  an internal community.In 2022, CMA CGM and CEVA Logistics harmonised their career management processes, and extended them to the recently acquired entities (Ingram Micro CLS, GEFCO, Colis Priv\u00e9). This process identifies talents, proposes development goals, and provides access to training programmes and global mobility opportunities. To support the transformation and performance of all divisions of the Group, CMA CGM has developed a database of 56 key skills. The key skills database has been integrated into all development tools and programmes and is used for the assessment and development of employees. Each employee will be able to refer to it when our new performance process is deployed in early 2023, and use it to become aware, in a transparent manner, of the skills to be developed in order to progress within the Group.This year, the third promotion of the GM School was composed of 24 participants, of which 25% were women and 76% were non-French (20 different nationalities). As a further step, CMA CGM merged the human resources information systems of CMA CGM and CEVA Logistics. The new platform (MyHR) groups the new HR processes, such as talent reviews and performance reviews. It is gradually being expanded to the Group\u2019s new companies.  ",

In 2022,  this training was deployed to the QHSE managers of shore-based activities and the managers of  the shore-based sites (terminals and depots). Number of young talents Each year, the Group hires over 50% of its interns and apprentices during their final year of study. They are seen as a talent pool and  an investment in the future. The Group has created facilitation kits designed  to help teams stimulate their collective intelligence, strengthen their cohesion and solve specific problems. These kits, called C-Boxes, assist teams to organise workshops independently. Nine C-Boxes are already available: Team, Change, Creativity, Diversity, Feedback, Welcome Back, Sustainability, Better Ways and Digital.International Corporate VolunteersCMA CGM\u2019s main objective is to maintain diversity in recruitment.  The Group hires candidates with international profiles (34%) and a variety of educational backgrounds: 57% of them have graduated from business schools, 18% from engineering schools and 25% from political studies institutes or universities. ApprenticesTo promote this solution, the CMA CGM Academy organised two \"C-Box Days\" at the head office. Over a hundred employees expressed an interest and will be assisted in facilitating one or more workshops independently.Since 2022, the CMA CGM Academy trains tutors of interns and work-placement staff to familiarise them with their supervisory and training role.The operation of ships powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG) requires crews to acquire new skills. Under international regulations, seafarers on board ships subject to the IGF international safety code must receive mandatory training in order to embark on such ships. Depending on their rank, seafarers must complete the training and hold a basic or advanced certificate. Over 1,500 seafarers have been trained at the basic level and over 600 at the advanced level. Exceeding the requirements of international regulations, the Group has set up additional training courses which have been taken by over 300 seafarers. All identified talents undergo a specific development programme: training in leadership, coaching, mentoring and internal sponsoring. CMA CGM updates its succession plans annually. In 2022, the Group provided 872,259 hours of training (CMA CGM + CEVA Logistics). The target for training is 3 days of training per employee per year in 2022. The target was achieved within  CMA CGM with 3,65 days of training per person. At CEVA Logistics, employees receive an average of 0,77 days of training per year.Ongoing training of seafarers is also provided by  the Seagull OLP platform, which offers regularly updated training (e-learning). This platform also supports the Competence Management System (CMS), which forms an integral part of the crew members\u2019 career management.For the seventh year in a row, CMA CGM Group has been awarded the Happy IndexTrainees certification, which rewards the quality of internships and work-placement contracts. Around 90% of respondents would recommend the Group for an internship or work placement.",

Each challenge raises funds for organisations involved in environmental conservation. -  Logistics in crisis situations to define and adapt  the role of logistics in the event of a crisis and to adjust flows during natural disasters or wars. The objective of setting up a CSR training plan  is to raise awareness and train employees in CSR in order to prepare them for the evolutions that climate change will bring to their jobs. This will also help  to meet certain regulatory requirements. The factors identified in the risk map, combined with the needs relevant to CSR issues pinpointed during a review of the situation, contributed to the construction of the Group\u2019s CSR training plan. This plan is based on the three priorities of the Group\u2019s CSR strategy.-  Transforming the world of work to adapt to its changes and create an inclusive, egalitarian and diverse environment. The Group has engaged two impact start-ups to implement this project : WeNow, a start-up that raises awareness and provides training on climate issues, and M\u00e3o Boa, which specialises in employee mobilisation and which was incubated in ZEBOX,  the Group\u2019s start-up incubator. CMA CGM Group has established TANGRAM, a new centre of excellence open to all parties who wish  to collaborate to create the sustainable transport and logistics of tomorrow. Its goal is to make a pivotal contribution to the transport and logistics sectors  in response to the major challenges facing the world today (environmental, societal, geopolitical, etc.).It is based on two interconnected priorities, training and innovation, and aims to respond to seven major challenges: This year, CMA CGM launched My Climate School, the cornerstone of this new training plan.  In partnership with AXA Climate, this programme includes two types of modules.-  Decarbonisation and preserving biodiversity by researching and developing sustainable mobility solutions based on renewable energy. TANGRAM is a catalyst designed to create a rich ecosystem and develop synergies between experts in all areas: CMA CGM Group employees, start-ups, customers and partners, major companies, research centres, universities, competitors, etc. -  The \"Understanding\" modules present the scientific fundamentals of global warming, its impact on biodiversity, and the need to think about it systemically.-  Digitalisation and technological innovation to anticipate the future by developing new solutions: autonomous vehicles, robotics, metaverse, smart data, AI and new ways to grow businesses. -  The \"Action\" modules deal with the impact of the climate transition on the company\u2019s activities: carbon footprint, climate strategy, circular economy, etc. and how to integrate the climate into the various business lines.The project is already active through \"Powered by TANGRAM\" training courses, university chairs and partnerships with start-ups that offer technologies such as disruptive mobility. In January 2024, a new venue will host all these projects at a prestigious location at La Pointe Rouge in Marseille.-  Exploiting the potential of the space industry  to optimise existing means of transport by creating orbital logistics projects. Eight modules are available for the Group\u2019s IT, legal, finance, marketing and communication, responsible purchasing, human resources, risk management,  and corporate services functions.-  Changes in consumption patterns to adapt  to changes in society and consumption habits in order to be more in tune with the needs and expectations of the Group\u2019s customers. -  Geopolitical developments to closely monitor geopolitical tensions and anticipate the impact  of a new global balance on logistics flows.",

In 2022, the CMA CGM Group renewed its support to Ecocean, a pioneering company in the creation of artificial habitats for young fish, thus contributing to the development of the CASCIOMAR PROJECT. This project, conducted in close collaboration with the professional fishermen of Cassis, La Ciotat and Marseille, aims to accelerate the resilience  of the marine ecosystem and more specifically  to reboost coastal fish stocks.In Italy, CEVA Logistics employees can donate hours  of holiday leave to support humanitarian projects.  Some employees took advantage of this time  to organise humanitarian fundraising events.  The Group also provided individual support  to employees involved in solidarity actions,  in particular those who travelled to the Ukrainian  border, in collaboration with NGOs. Colis Priv\u00e9, which joined CMA CGM Group in 2022, became a sponsor of GERES (an NGO specialised in climate solidarity). For 45 years, this non-profit organisation has carried out climate solidarity actions to improve people\u2019s living conditions and combat the effects of climate change. Colis Priv\u00e9 will,  in particular, support an inclusive energy transition project in underprivileged neighbourhoods in Marseille.

Below are some examples: CMA CGM operate a network of over 50 terminals worldwide with a wide variety of operations and equipment, but generally in a sensitive urban context. This gives us a dual responsibility, both in terms of innovation to be able to support the development of a whole range of decarbonised port equipment, and to develop our own green and decarbonised energy resources in our terminals,  in order to accelerate and better control the time frame of our decarbonisation roadmap. This twofold challenge has been the guiding principle of our actions since 2022 and we will begin an ambitious action plan for a dozen priority terminals in 2023. CMA CGM has a department tasked with optimising the design and propulsion of new ships ordered. -  At the Los Angeles terminal (FMS terminal),  an experiment of hydrogen-powered container handling equipment is underway.In order to have a young fleet, the Group has  a regular fleet renewal policy.Various actions have been undertaken in the terminals and depots to reduce their environmental impact: photovoltaic panels if the site permits, hybrid handling equipment, reduced fuel consumption, supply of biodiesel, LED lighting, etc.In addition, the Group is constantly on the lookout for new technical solutions: disruptive hull designs, state-of-the-art aerodynamic superstructures, and e-fuel ready engines. All these innovations make it possible to exceed International Maritime Organization (IMO) criteria, in particular the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for new ships. thanks to state-of-the-art ships -  Malta Freeport Terminal has installed over  25,000 sqm of photovoltaic surface: panels on the roofs of its buildings, solar car parks, solar bus shelters and electric car charging stations. This project, which is exemplary in its scale and diversity, saves more than 2,000 tonnes of CO per year.The Group continuously improves the performance  of its own fleet to generate fuel savings and reduce its carbon impact. Innovations optimise the hydrodynamics ",

Colis Priv\u00e9 and GEFCO, which joined the Group in 2022, participate to CEVA Logistics\u2019 road transport decarbonisation plan. - seven electric trucks in Brazil;-  several electric vans and a low-emission vehicle project in Thailand; A plan to green our warehouse portfolio, based on a close cooperation with building owners and customers, is being implemented. Criteria have been added to our property and procurement policy in order  to take into account : environmental standards certification of buildings (HQE, BREEAM, etc.), LED lighting, photovoltaic panels and systems for optimising and monitoring energy consumption. In 2022,  CEVA Logistics opened a new warehouse in Bogota, Colombia, equipped with the latest technology : it is particularly efficient in terms of energy and, therefore, GHG emissions. This 15,000 sqm warehouse is optimised for recycling operations, covered with solar panels, and has been coated with photocatalytic paint, destroying certain organic compounds and pollutants. This site has been awarded the EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) certification. Photovoltaic panels have also been installed on the roofs of our warehouses in Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates and Peru and it will continue over the next few years. -  a successful trial of electric trucks in the United States which will lead to an order for around  50 vehicles in 2023; If the installation of photovoltaic panels is not possible, new electricity contracts are converted into green electricity contracts (low-carbon energy). To maintain an efficient fleet, CEVA Logistics chooses recent models when renewing equipment, and encourages its subcontractors to do the same. Its subsidiary, GEFCO has converted its entire fleet of long-haul car carriers to the Euro VI standard*, which imposes emission limit values for nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and particulates.-  three electric vans and electric truck trials in  the United Kingdom;Surface area  of sites equipped  with photovoltaic panels - an electric truck distribution test in France.This year, an ambitious investment plan for electric trucks was adopted.

        "text": "CMA CGM supports the government\u2019s efforts  to accelerate the climate agenda. It is crucial to preserve the sector\u2019s ability to streamline international trade by following responsible criteria. Technological neutrality should also be ensured,  as the technical solutions that will enable the maritime sector to decarbonise are still at highly variable stages of maturity. This will permit stakeholders  to adapt to solutions as they become available. It is also important that the laws not penalise pioneering companies that have chosen to act quickly and have invested in more energy-efficient ships.The objective of the European Union\u2019s (EU) Green Deal is to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. In addition to other regulatory measures, the European Green Taxonomy is a first step to promoting sustainable investment and financing. It establishes a list of economic activities the EU deems environmentally sustainable and requires companies to report the proportion of their turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenditure that is aligned with these activities.The Group encourages the adoption of ambitious standards, in Europe and worldwide, that will enable the maritime and logistics sector to do their share in the collective effort to reduce greenhouse gases. The information disclosed will permit a more meaningful comparison of companies and will encourage public and private investment in projects that contribute to the transition to  a sustainable, low-carbon economy. CMA CGM Group, which does not issue securities traded on a regulated market, will be required to comply with the taxonomy starting in financial year 2024. Nevertheless, the Group actively follows these regulatory developments and is preparing for these deadlines by making an initial inventory of its activities that come within the scope of the climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. The overall coherence of the proposed laws and those already in force should be a priority. The interrelated nature of these laws is a source of complexity which should not become an obstacle to the effort required.As an international player, CMA CGM Group backs global solutions adopted by the IMO, rather than regional solutions, and encourages institutions  to adopt approaches based on objectives rather than dictating predefined means.Furthermore, in view of the future obligations that will be imposed on the maritime transport industry and the associated financial penalties, it is essential to give the maritime sector the full panoply of available tools and solutions to engineer this transition successfully.The energy transition of the maritime sector requires assistance, particularly in terms of R&D. The revenues generated by regulatory obligations should therefore be allocated to decarbonising maritime transport. The investments needed to decarbonise the sector are huge, and transport operators therefore need time and a clear picture of the implementation schedule of the various regulations.In addition, all stakeholders must be mobilised in order to ensure the availability of the necessary quantities of low-emission fuels and their distribution in the dedicated networks.It is essential that alternative fuels, which are a key decarbonisation lever, and the emissions gains associated with their use, be considered on a life cycle basis and taken into account in the measures adopted. The Group supports the revision of the IMO\u2019s greenhouse gas targets and its alignment with  the voluntary Net Zero 2050 target. To comply with these initial short-term measures, CMA CGM set It is supported by a cross-functional team that brings together employees from various departments: energy, chartering, operations, lines, R&D, regulatory, etc. Its members have been working since 2021 on assessing the performance of each vessel and improving or replacing the least efficient vessels,  in order to ensure compliance with the regulations to come in 2023. In addition, there is a need for the actors of the maritime industry to be able to directly claim biogas-related gains by recognising guarantees of origin as a traceability mechanism or proof of compliance with regulatory obligations. This recognition is not yet formally explicit in texts under discussion which should be applicable to maritime transport  (EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime). This lack of clarity should be addressed quickly in order to provide certainty to investments and accelerate biogas production without increasing infrastructure costs. CMA CGM supports the Green Deal objectives announced by the European Commission. However, the Group is particularly vigilant with respect to the proposed provisions of the \"Fit for 55\" legislative package. It must be coherent and compatible with  a future international framework. It is therefore important to retain the review clauses that permit European measures to be aligned with those of the IMO.",

All newly built ships are pre-equipped with shore power connection systems so they will be ready and able to connect to shore power when ports are equipped.Number of vessels for shore power connectionTo be able to connect to shore power, a vessel must be \"adapted\" (retrofits to the vessel to install a connection) and \"equipped\" with mobile connection equipment (a container or cable reel to make  the connection). A vessel can be considered compatible with shore power connection only if it is adapted and equipped. Percentage  of the fleet under adapted ownership  for shore power*CMA CGM is working to retrofit its ships so they can be equipped and thus connect to shore power in ports where this is possible. Number of removable connectors for shore power availableBetween 2013 and 2022, 66 owned vessels were adapted for shore power connection (either retrofitted or original equipment) and 56% of vessels are fully equipped. CMA CGM has 66 mobile connection facilities. The aim is to equip all ships that are already adapted.  In order to cover maintenance periods, transfers between vessels and availability in certain ports, the number of mobile equipment must exceed the number of adapted vessels.CMA CGM vessels are already connecting to shore power in California, in accordance with local law, and on a voluntary basis in various ports that offer this service, mainly in China and Europe. For example,  in 2022, CMA CGM and Shanghai International Port (SIGP) signed  a collaboration agreement to accelerate the use of shore power.",

To achieve these goals, both partners use innovative techniques, such as:  The Northern Sea Route (NSR), which runs along the coast of Siberia and links Asia  to Europe, is now navigable due to the effects of climate change. However, the rich, unique and largely unexplored biodiversity of  the Arctic plays an essential role in regulating artificial intelligence software to detect suspicious containers; Every year around the world, containers are lost at sea due to difficult sailing conditions or rare incidents. In 2022, one of our container ships, APL VANDA, encountered an extreme weather event and lost 69 containers. We regret this accident and have increased our vigilance. We continue to deploy best practices to avoid future losses: weather watches, fleet navigation centres, weather routing and on-board container security systems. We have made \"zero loss\" of containers one of our priority objectives. Finally, we also participate in discussions with professional associations, such as Armateurs de France, and with the competent authorities to further reduce, collectively, the risk of losing containers at sea. -  a pilot project for non-invasive screening of the types of species transported, for example using air sampling equipment.",

The Group will soon roll out a training programme to optimise the use of the system and help seafarers recognise the different types of marine mammals. Integrating logistics sites into their natural environment, in particular to reduce their impact in terms of surface sealing and visual nuisances presents a major challenge.In marine mammal breeding areas off the east coast of the United States and Canada, CMA CGM vessels are required to reduce their speed to a maximum of 10 knots to prevent the risk of collision. On the west coast, near the Santa Barbara Islands, CMA CGM has made a voluntary commitment to the Green Flag speed reduction programme. Consistently with CEVA Logistics\u2019 real estate policy, for all new projects, building selection criteria take into account environmental certifications, such as High Environmental Quality (HQE), Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). These certifications include landscape integration aspects.Since 2020, CMA CGM Group has reinforced its procedures for the maritime transport of protected species, whose trade is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In the event of  a suspicious animal or plant commodity, CMA CGM requires the customer to expressly declare whether the species is covered by CITES and, if so, to provide the required export permit. Preventive measures may include suspension of certain exports, such as timber from Gambia, which contributes to deforestation in West Africa.  Furthermore, with the help of the CMA CGM Fleet Navigation Centre, whenever possible, the Group endeavours to reduce the speeds of its ships to reduce the risk of collision in marine mammal sanctuaries.  A trial was also launched at our Doncaster site in the United Kingdom to create flowering meadows around this warehouse. A large variety of insect species was observed in the meadows and the feedback from employees has been extremely positive. This initiative will be repeated and expanded in the future.  ",

Due to a flood, only 15,000 of the 30,000 trees could be planted. The remaining 15,000 trees will be planted by the NGO. The Group\u2019s employees fully supported this project and gained awareness of the importance of the mangrove ecosystem in Senegal.In 2019, CMA CGM had already conducted underwater noise measurements on the CMA CGM MAGELLAN.",

The goal of the partnership between CMA CGM and Plastic Flamingo is to collect 120 tonnes of plastic waste in one year in the Greater Manila area and  to recycle it. This partnership also raises awareness of the dangers of marine plastic pollution. Finally, this project has created 12 full-time jobs.In each country, the ship will also serve as a laboratory for technological innovations developed by start-ups: water purification, cogeneration, etc. The Group has depots in various countries around the world, which are subject to specific regulations in each region. The Group endeavours to reduce the impacts of its shore-based activities.When a ship must be decommissioned, the Group chooses dismantling yards that are systematically audited and that comply with international and local health, safety and environmental standards.  A set of requirements governs these operations,  such as conducting cutting operations on impermeable surfaces and storage of hazardous waste. No ship in the Group\u2019s fleet were decommissioned in 2021 and 2022. Nine CMA CGM depots are equipped with wastewater treatment systems.

For the inland transport of goods,  this means in particular a modal shift from road to rail or barge. In 2022, 64% of the Group\u2019s inland freight was transported by rail or barge. Despite a shortage of these services and infrastructure in certain parts of the world, CMA CGM\u2019s goal is to increase this share to 75% by 2025. For the past two years, CMA CGM has offered its customers in the Asia-Pacific region the possibility of reloading containers and avoiding empty trips with the Container Reuse offer. A digital platform facilitates orchestrating the reuse of empty containers by various actors as close as possible to the place where they are unloaded, and avoids returning the containers to their point of origin. This optimisation of road transport planning avoids empty trips and the associated carbon emissions.
