We are commit-\nted to expanding our emerging-consumers business offer to continue \nclosing the gap for people who need access to low-cost financial \nservices. In 2015, we managed to break through the 50-million-\ncustomer mark in the rapidly expanding emerging-consumers mar-\nket. In 2017, due to a challenging environment, revenues were at \naround \u20ac 256 mn \u2013 equivalent to around \u20ac 4.37 in annual revenue per \ncustomer for this market. 99 % of these revenues still stem from micro-\ninsurance. The great majority of these customers hold one insurance \npolicy only, mostly life insurance, which clearly shows that our cus-\ntomers are still severely underinsured. We are also aware they are \nunderserved in many other areas as well, such as savings, invest-\nments, and health services. In response, we have expanded our solu-\ntions beyond microinsurance and now offer microsavings and micro-\nequity options.  \n",
